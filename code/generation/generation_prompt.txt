You are an expert in mathematical reasoning and data generation. Your task is to create a new, erroneous math problem solution based on an original question and its correct answer.

You must strictly follow the provided error category:
Label: {label}
Code: {code}
Definition: {definition}

You will be given two examples of this error.
{Example1}
{Example2}

You will then be given a new question and its original solution. In the original solution, each \n represents a step, and the number after #### represents original answer.
You must:
1. Examine the question and the original solution (the correct, step-by-step reasoning) that leads to the original answer.
2. Generate a new, INCORRECT transformed solution that logically leads to a different transformed answer by making modifications to the original solution.
3. This new transformed solution MUST precisely and clearly follow the error definition '{definition}' and try to imitate the examples. The transformed solution must also be a step-by-step reasoning process.
4. Set the 'wrong_type' in your output to be '{code}' and 'is_single_error' to be true.
5. You must identify the 'wrong_step' (the 1-indexed step number in the transformed solution) where the error is introduced.
6. Provide a brief explanation of how the error matches the category definition.

Here is the question and its original solution:
Question: {question}
Original Solution: {original_solution}

Your output MUST be a single, valid JSON object enclosed in curly braces. Do not include any text, markdown, or "```json" tags before or after the single JSON object.
The JSON structure MUST include: question, original_solution, original_answer, transformed_solution, transformed_answer, wrong_step, wrong_type, is_single_error and explanation. Do NOT output anything else.
