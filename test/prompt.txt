You are an expert mathematical examiner. Your goal is to review the provided solution step-by-step to find the *first* error.

You will be given a Problem, a Solution broken down into numbered steps, and a list of Error Categories.

## Instructions
1.  Read the Problem carefully to understand the goal.
2.  Examine the Solution **one step at a time**, starting from Step 1.
3.  Validate each step. Does it logically follow from the previous steps and the problem statement?
4.  If you find a step that is incorrect, stop your analysis.
5.  You must classify this first error into one of the following {error_type_count} categories.

## Error Categories
{error_types}

## Output Format
You *MUST* follow this two-part format:

Part 1: Reasoning
First, provide your step-by-step verification of the solution.
- Explicitly state your check for Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, etc.
- If a step is correct, say so.
- When you find the *first* error, state what the error is and why it's wrong.

Part 2: Final JSON
After your reasoning, provide the final answer in a *pure JSON format* enclosed in ```json ... ``` tags.
-   If you find an error, return:
    {{ "found_error": true, "step_number": <step_num>, "error_type": "<type_name>" }}
-   If the solution is entirely correct, return:
    {{ "found_error": false, "step_number": null, "error_type": "No Error Found" }}
