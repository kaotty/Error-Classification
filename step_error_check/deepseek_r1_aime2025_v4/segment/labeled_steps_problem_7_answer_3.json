Since the words are sorted alphabetically, the last word would be the one that comes last in the alphabetical order. For example, if there's a word starting with L, that would definitely be last. But since L is the last letter, the only possible word starting with L would be LA, LB, LC, etc., but since we have to pair letters, L can only be paired with letters after it if we follow alphabetical order. Wait, no—each pair is ordered alphabetically. So regardless of how you pair them, when you form the word, the two letters are placed next to each other in alphabetical order. So if you pair L with G, the word would be GL, right? Because G comes before L. So actually, the words can't start with letters after L, because L is the last letter. So the latest possible starting letter is L, but only if paired with a letter after L, which doesn't exist. Therefore, the latest possible word is KL, because K comes before L. Wait, KL would be ordered as KL. But if you pair K with L, then the word is KL. If you pair K with someone else, say K with A, then the word is AK. So KL is a possible word.

Wait, each pair is ordered alphabetically. So if you pair L with any other letter, since L is the last letter, the word will always be [letter]L, where [letter] is the one paired with L. So for example, pairing L with A gives AL, pairing L with B gives BL, ..., pairing L with K gives KL. So the latest possible word is KL. So KL is the last possible word in the alphabetical list. Similarly, JL would come before KL, IL before JL, etc. So KL is the last possible word. Therefore, if KL exists in the pairing, then KL will be the last word. If KL doesn't exist, then the last word would be the next highest possible, which is something like K followed by another letter, but since K is the second last letter, if K isn't paired with L, then K would be paired with someone else, say K and J, which would be JK.

Then, among all the words, the highest word would be whichever word has the highest starting letter. So if L is paired with someone, the word will be [something]L, where [something] is the letter paired with L. Since L is the last letter, all words involving L will be [letter]L where [letter] comes before L. Therefore, among all possible words, the ones starting with the highest letter possible will determine the last word. So if L is paired with K, then KL is the last word. If L is paired with J, then JL is the last word, unless K is paired with someone higher? Wait, K is paired with someone else. Wait, K is the 11th letter, L is the 12th. So the starting letters of the words can't be higher than K unless paired with L. Wait, no—if K is paired with someone else, say K and H, then the word is HK. But HK comes before HL, which would be if H is paired with L. So actually, the starting letter of the word determines its place in the list. So the highest starting letter possible is K, if K is paired with L. Otherwise, the highest starting letter is J if J is paired with L, but J paired with L gives JL, which would be higher than any other word starting with J paired with someone else.

Wait, no: K paired with someone else, say K and M (but M isn't in our set), so K paired with, say, A gives AK, paired with B gives BK, ..., paired with J gives JK, paired with L gives KL.

But if L is paired with someone lower, like H, then HL is higher than GL, FL, etc. So the last word would be the highest [letter]L where [letter] is the partner of L.

Wait, KJ starts with K, JL starts with J. So KJ is after JL? Wait, KJ is K followed by J, which is ordered as JK? Wait, no. Wait, each pair is arranged in alphabetical order.

So the highest possible first letter is K paired with L (KL), then J paired with L (JL), etc. So the probability that G is in the last word is the probability that the highest pair (which determines the last word) includes G.\n\nSo if we can compute the probability that G is part of the highest pair, then that would be the answer. However, the highest pair is the pair with the maximum first letter. But pairs are ordered, so the highest pair is the one where the two letters, when ordered alphabetically, have the highest starting letter.\n\nFor example, if K and L are paired, the word is KL, which is the highest possible. If L is paired with someone else, say J, then JL is the word. If K is paired with someone else, say I, then IK is the word. So the highest pair is the maximum over all pairs of their ordered first letters.\n\nTherefore, the last word is determined by the pair that has the highest first letter. If multiple pairs have the same first letter, then the one with the highest second letter.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the probability that G is in the pair that is the lexicographically greatest among all pairs.\n\nTherefore, we need to compute the probability that G is in the maximum pair. To compute this, we can think of all possible pairs and determine the probability that G is part of the maximum pair.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem where you have n elements and you randomly pair them, and you want the probability that a specific element is in the pair with the maximum value.\n\nIn our case, the \"value\" of a pair is its lexicographical order. The maximum pair is the one that comes last alphabetically. Each pair is an unordered pair of two letters, but when ordered alphabetically, they form a word.\n\nSo the problem is analogous to: given 12 elements with an order (A-L), randomly partition them into 6 pairs. What is the probability that the element G is in the pair that, when ordered, is the maximum among all ordered pairs.\n\nIn other words, we need to compute the probability that G is paired with a letter such that their ordered pair is greater than all other ordered pairs.\n\nTo compute this, we can use the concept of \"record\" or \"maximum\" in probability. However, since pairs are compared lexicographically, the maximum pair is determined first by the first letter, then by the second letter.\n\nSo the maximum pair is the one with the highest first letter.

If there are multiple pairs with the same first letter (which can't happen in this case because all pairs are disjoint), wait, no. Each pair is unique and consists of two distinct letters. Therefore, each first letter can appear at most once in the list of pairs. Wait, no. For example, if two different pairs have the same first letter. Wait, no, because each pair is ordered alphabetically, so if you have two pairs involving the same first letter, say A paired with B and A paired with C, but since each letter is only paired once, you can't have two pairs starting with A. Each letter is in exactly one pair. Therefore, each first letter can appear at most once in the list of pairs. Therefore, the maximum first letter is unique. Therefore, the maximum pair is the pair with the highest first letter. If there are multiple pairs with the same highest first letter, but since each first letter is unique, this can't happen. Therefore, there is a unique pair with the highest first letter, which is the pair containing the highest letter possible. Wait, but the highest first letter is determined by the highest letter in any pair. Wait, no. For example, if L is paired with K, then KL is the pair, starting with K. If L is paired with J, then JL starts with J. If L is paired with A, then AL starts with A. So the first letter of the pair is determined by the lower of the two letters in the pair. Wait, no.

But the remaining letters include H, I, J, K, which are all higher than G. If these are paired with A-F, their pairs start with A-F. If they are paired among themselves, their pairs start with H, I, J, K. Therefore, to have GL be the maximum pair, all H-K must be paired with A-F. So similar to previous cases.",

      "reasoning_step": "Wait, I think I made a mistake here. When G is paired with L (i=5), the letters after L are none, so the requirement is that all letters after L (none) are paired with A-F. But in reality, the requirement should be that all letters H-K (since L is already paired with G) are paired with A-F. Otherwise, if any of H-K are paired among themselves or with letters higher than G (which they are), their pairs would start with H-K, which are higher than G, making their pairs higher than GL. Therefore, for GL to be the maximum pair, all H-K must be paired with A-F.\n\nSo in this case, letters H-K (4 letters: H, I, J, K) must be paired with A-F (6 letters). So we need to pair 4 letters from A-F with H-K. The number of ways is C(6,4) * 4! (choose 4 letters from A-F, assign each to H-K). Then, the remaining 6 - 4 = 2 letters from A-F pair among themselves (1 way). So total ways: C(6,4) * 4! * 1 = 15 * 24 * 1 = 360.\n\nTherefore, for i=5 (G paired with L), the number of valid pairings is 360.\n\nTherefore, summing over i=1,3,5:\n\nTotal valid pairings = 360 (i=1) + 90 (i=3) + 360 (i=5) = 360 + 90 + 360 = 810.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 810 / 10395.\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 15: 810 ÷15=54, 10395 ÷15=693.\n\n54/693. Divide numerator and denominator by 9: 54 ÷9=6, 693 ÷9=77.\n\nSo 6/77. Therefore, the probability is 6/77, so m=6, n=77, m+n=83.",

Alternatively, using the concept from probability that the probability a specific element is in the maximum pair is equal to the sum over all possible partners of G of the probability that G's pair is the maximum pair.\n\nFor each possible partner of G (H, I, J, K, L), compute the probability that pairing G with that partner results in their pair being the maximum, then sum those probabilities.\n\nFor G paired with H: The pair is GH. For GH to be the maximum, all pairs involving I, J, K, L must be paired with A-F. The probability of this is [number of ways to pair I-L with A-F] / [total number of ways to pair the remaining letters]. Similarly for other partners.\n\nBut this is similar to our previous calculation.",

      "reasoning_step": "Alternatively, consider that the maximum pair is determined by the highest letter that is paired with a higher letter. For example, if L is paired with K, then KL is the maximum pair. If L is paired with someone lower, say A, then the maximum pair is the highest pair among the remaining letters.\n\nThe probability that G is in the maximum pair can be calculated using the principle of inclusion. However, this might get complicated.\n\nBut our previous calculation seems consistent. We considered all valid cases where G is paired with H, J, or L, and ensured that all higher letters are paired with lower ones, resulting in the maximum pair being G's pair. The total number of such pairings is 810, leading to a probability of 6/77. Therefore, the answer should be 83.\n",
