Maybe I can find them later?\n\nNow, points K and L are inside the triangle with AK = AL = 14. So, both K and L are 14 units away from point A. That suggests they lie on a circle centered at A with radius 14. Also, BK = 14 and CL = 14. So, point K is 14 units away from B, and point L is 14 units away from C. Additionally, the distance between K and L is 14. So, KL = 14.\n\nHmm, this seems like there are multiple constraints here. Let me try to break it down.",

      "reasoning_step": "First, since AK = AL = 14, points K and L lie on the circle centered at A with radius 14. Let's call this circle Γ. Then, point K is also on the circle centered at B with radius 14, and point L is on the circle centered at C with radius 14. The distance between K and L is also 14. So, K and L are two points such that:\n\n1. K is on the intersection of circle Γ (center A, radius 14) and circle centered at B with radius 14.\n2. L is on the intersection of circle Γ and circle centered at C with radius 14.\n3. The distance between K and L is 14.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe coordinate geometry can help here. Let me assign coordinates to the triangle. Let's place point A at the origin (0,0). Let’s let AB lie along the x-axis and AC lie along the y-axis. So, point B is (c, 0) and point C is (0, b), where b² + c² = 1444.\n\nNow, points K and L are inside triangle ABC. Let's denote K as (x1, y1) and L as (x2, y2). Then:\n\nFor point K:\n- AK = 14: √(x1² + y1²) = 14 ⇒ x1² + y1² = 196.\n- BK = 14: √((x1 - c)² + y1²) = 14 ⇒ (x1 - c)² + y1² = 196.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives:\n(x1 - c)² + y1² - (x1² + y1²) = 196 - 196 ⇒ (x1² - 2c x1 + c²) - x1² = 0 ⇒ -2c x1 + c² = 0 ⇒ x1 = c/2.\n\nSo, the x-coordinate of K is c/2. Then, substituting back into AK = 14:\n\n(c/2)² + y1² = 196 ⇒ y1² = 196 - c²/4 ⇒ y1 = √(196 - c²/4).\n\nSimilarly, for point L:\n\n- AL = 14: √(x2² + y2²) = 14 ⇒ x2² + y2² = 196.\n- CL = 14: √(x2² + (y2 - b)²) = 14 ⇒ x2² + (y2 - b)² = 196.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives:\nx2² + (y2 - b)² - (x2² + y2²) = 196 - 196 ⇒ y2² - 2b y2 + b² - y2² = 0 ⇒ -2b y2 + b² = 0 ⇒ y2 = b/2.\n\nSo, the y-coordinate of L is b/2. Substituting back into AL = 14:\n\nx2² + (b/2)² = 196 ⇒ x2² = 196 - b²/4 ⇒ x2 = √(196 - b²/4).\n\nNow, we also know that KL = 14. Let's compute the distance between K and L. Since K is (c/2, y1) and L is (x2, b/2), the distance KL is:\n\n√[(x2 - c/2)² + (b/2 - y1)²] = 14.\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(x2 - c/2)² + (b/2 - y1)² = 196.\n\nBut we already have expressions for x2 and y1 in terms of b and c. Let's substitute those:\n\nx2 = √(196 - b²/4), y1 = √(196 - c²/4).\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n[√(196 - b²/4) - c/2]² + [b/2 - √(196 - c²/4)]² = 196.\n\nThis looks complicated. Maybe expanding the squares?\n\nFirst term: [√(196 - b²/4) - c/2]²\n= (196 - b²/4) - 2*(c/2)*√(196 - b²/4) + (c²)/4\n= 196 - b²/4 - c√(196 - b²/4) + c²/4\n\nSecond term: [b/2 - √(196 - c²/4)]²\n= (b²)/4 - 2*(b/2)*√(196 - c²/4) + (196 - c²/4)\n= b²/4 - b√(196 - c²/4) + 196 - c²/4\n\nAdding both terms:\n\nFirst term + Second term = [196 - b²/4 - c√(196 - b²/4) + c²/4] + [b²/4 - b√(196 - c²/4) + 196 - c²/4]\n\nSimplify:\n\n196 - b²/4 + c²/4 - c√(196 - b²/4) + b²/4 + 196 - c²/4 - b√(196 - c²/4)\n\nNotice that -b²/4 and +b²/4 cancel, similarly c²/4 and -c²/4 cancel. So:\n\n196 + 196 - c√(196 - b²/4) - b√(196 - c²/4) = 392 - c√(196 - b²/4) - b√(196 - c²/4) = 196.\n\nSo,\n\n392 - c√(196 - b²/4) - b√(196 - c²/4) = 196\n\nSubtract 196 from both sides:\n\n196 - c√(196 - b²/4) - b√(196 - c²/4) = 0\n\nRearranged:\n\nc√(196 - b²/4) + b√(196 - c²/4) = 196\n\nHmm, this equation relates b and c. Remember that b² + c² = 1444 (since BC = 38). So, we have two equations:\n\n1. b² + c² = 1444\n\n2. c√(196 - b²/4) + b√(196 - c²/4) = 196\n\nThis seems challenging. Maybe there's a substitution or symmetry here. Let me denote sqrt(196 - b²/4) as something. Let's let’s denote sqrt(196 - b²/4) = m and sqrt(196 - c²/4) = n. Then, equation 2 becomes c*m + b*n = 196.\n\nBut also, note that m² = 196 - b²/4 ⇒ b²/4 = 196 - m² ⇒ b² = 784 - 4m².\n\nSimilarly, n² = 196 - c²/4 ⇒ c² = 784 - 4n².\n\nBut from equation 1, b² + c² = 1444 ⇒ (784 - 4m²) + (784 - 4n²) = 1444 ⇒ 1568 - 4(m² + n²) = 1444 ⇒ -4(m² + n²) = 1444 - 1568 = -124 ⇒ m² + n² = 31.\n\nSo, m² + n² = 31. Also, equation 2 is c*m + b*n = 196.\n\nBut since b² = 784 - 4m² and c² = 784 - 4n², perhaps we can express b and c in terms of m and n. Let's take square roots:\n\nb = sqrt(784 - 4m²) and c = sqrt(784 - 4n²). But substituting into equation 2:\n\nsqrt(784 - 4n²)*m + sqrt(784 - 4m²)*n = 196.",

But in a right triangle with hypotenuse 38, unless it's an isosceles right triangle, but 38² = 1444, so sides would be 38/√2 ≈ 26.87, but then b and c would be equal. However, if b = c, then equation 2 becomes c*sqrt(196 - c²/4) + c*sqrt(196 - c²/4) = 196 ⇒ 2c*sqrt(196 - c²/4) = 196 ⇒ c*sqrt(196 - c²/4) = 98.\n\nLet’s check if this is possible. Let’s denote c² = x. Then, sqrt(196 - x/4) = sqrt(196 - x/4). Then, c*sqrt(196 - c²/4) = sqrt(x)*sqrt(196 - x/4) = 98.\n\nSquare both sides: x*(196 - x/4) = 9604 ⇒ 196x - x²/4 = 9604 ⇒ Multiply both sides by 4: 784x - x² = 38416 ⇒ x² - 784x + 38416 = 0.\n\nSolve quadratic equation: x = [784 ± sqrt(784² - 4*38416)]/2.

Hmm, 7203 is 7203 ÷ 3 = 2401, which is 49². So sqrt(460992) = sqrt(64*3*2401) = 8*sqrt(3)*49 = 392√3. Therefore, x = [784 ± 392√3]/2 = 392 ± 196√3.",

Similarly, 392 + 196√3 is also positive. But if we take x = 392 - 196√3, then c = sqrt(392 - 196√3) = sqrt(196*(2 - √3)) = 14*sqrt(2 - √3). Similarly, if x = 392 + 196√3, c would be larger, but since in the original triangle, if b = c, then c would be 38/√2 ≈26.87. Let's check sqrt(392 + 196√3). sqrt(392 + 196*1.732) ≈ sqrt(392 + 339.47) ≈ sqrt(731.47) ≈ 27.05, which is close to 38/√2 ≈26.87. Hmm, discrepancy here.

This suggests that the area might involve √3, which often comes from equilateral triangles or 30-60-90 triangles. Maybe triangle ABC is related to such triangles? Wait, but ABC is a right triangle with hypotenuse 38. If it were a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides would be in the ratio 1:√3:2, but here BC is 38, so the sides would be 19, 19√3, 38.

Therefore, if we can model points K and L as vertices of an equilateral triangle with A, then perhaps coordinate geometry can be applied accordingly.\n\nLet me consider placing point A at (0,0), as before. Let’s suppose that point K is at (14, 0), but then AL =14 would mean L is somewhere on the circle radius 14 from A. But KL must be 14. However, if K is at (14,0), then L would need to be 14 units from both A and K, forming an equilateral triangle. That would put L at (7, 7√3). But then L is inside the triangle ABC. However, in this case, BK would be the distance from B (c,0) to K (14,0), which is |c -14|. But BK is supposed to be 14. So |c -14| =14 ⇒ c -14 =14 or c -14= -14 ⇒ c=28 or c=0. But c=0 is invalid because B would coincide with A. So c=28. Then, since BC=38, hypotenuse is 38, so AC= sqrt(38² -28²)= sqrt(1444 -784)= sqrt(660)= 2*sqrt(165). Then, point L is at (7,7√3).
