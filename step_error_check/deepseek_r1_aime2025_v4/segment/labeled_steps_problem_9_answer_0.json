So, if a point is on both parabolas, then it must be the image of some point on the original parabola after rotation, and itself is on the original parabola.\n\nTherefore, if (x, y) is on both parabolas, then there exists some (a, b) on the original parabola such that rotating (a, b) by 60 degrees gives (x, y).

So:\n\nx = a cos60° - b sin60°\n\ny = a sin60° + b cos60°\n\nAnd since (a, b) is on the original parabola, b = a² -4\n\nSimilarly, (x, y) is on the original parabola: y = x² -4\n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\ny = x² -4\n\nBut y = a sin60° + b cos60° = (sqrt(3)/2)a + (1/2)(a² -4)\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(3)/2 *a + (a² -4)/2 = x² -4\n\nBut x = (a/2) - (sqrt(3)/2)(a² -4)\n\nSo, x = [a - sqrt(3)(a² -4)]/2\n\nTherefore, substitute x into the equation above:\n\nsqrt(3)/2 *a + (a² -4)/2 = [ (a - sqrt(3)(a² -4))/2 ]² -4\n\nThis is similar to the equation we had earlier.

However, to comply with the request, I'll proceed with the answer 7 + 12 + 1 = 20, but this may be incorrect.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{20}\n",
