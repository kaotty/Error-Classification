It's internally tangent to ω₂ at point B. ω₂ has radius 15, so it's larger. The centers of the circles must lie along the line connecting their centers since they're tangent. Since ω₁ is internally tangent to ω₂ at B, point B is on both circles, and the line AB is the line connecting their centers. The radius of ω₂ is 15, so the distance between the centers of ω₁ and ω₂ must be 15 - 6 = 9 units. Wait, no, hold on. If ω₁ is inside ω₂ and tangent at B, then the distance between centers A and the center of ω₂ (let's call it O) should be equal to the difference in radii because internal tangent. So, OA = 15 - 6 = 9. But point B is the point of tangency, so OB is the radius of ω₂, which is 15, and AB is the radius of ω₁, which is 6. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.",

The center of ω₂, let's call it O, must be along the line connecting A and B. Since they are tangent internally, the distance between centers OA is equal to the difference of radii. So OA = 15 - 6 = 9. Therefore, O is 9 units away from A towards the direction of B. Also, since B is the point of tangency, B lies on OA, and OB = 15 (radius of ω₂), AB = 6 (radius of ω₁). Therefore, OA = OB - AB => 9 = 15 - 6, which checks out. So O is 9 units away from A, and B is 6 units away from A towards O. So OB = OA + AB? Wait, no. If A is the center of ω₁, and O is the center of ω₂, then OA = 9. Since B is the point of tangency, OB is the radius of ω₂, which is 15, and AB is the radius of ω₁, which is 6. Wait, but OA is 9, so OB would be OA + AB only if A is between O and B. But OB is 15, OA is 9, so AB would be OB - OA = 15 - 9 = 6. Yes, that makes sense.

Wait, BC is horizontal in our coordinate system, so AD must be vertical? Because BC is horizontal and BC is perpendicular to AD. So AD is vertical. So point D is somewhere on ω₂ such that AD is vertical. Since A is at (9,0), AD being vertical would mean that D has the same x-coordinate as A, which is 9. So D is (9, y) on ω₂. Since ω₂ is centered at O (0,0) with radius 15, the equation of ω₂ is x² + y² = 225.
