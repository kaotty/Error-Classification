For example, angle at D in DEF is equal to angle at A in ABC because DE is parallel to AB and DF is parallel to AC. So, angle at D is between DE and DF, which are parallel to AB and AC, so the angle should be equal to angle BAC, which is 84°. Similarly, angle at E is equal to angle ABC (60°), and angle at F is equal to angle ACB (36°). Therefore, triangle DEF has angles 84°, 60°, 36°, same as ABC. Therefore, the arcs DE, EF, FD in the circumcircle of DEF correspond to angles at F, D, E respectively.

Given angles at A, B, C: angle BAC=84°, angle ABC=60°, angle ACB=36°.

Since BC is from (0,0) to (1,0), midpoint D is (0.5,0). So BD is the line from (0,0) to (0.5,0), which is just the x-axis from 0 to 0.5. But DEF's circumcircle is centered at (0.398,0.2293) with radius ~0.251. The point D is (0.5,0) on the circle. The other intersection point G is another point on BD (the x-axis) intersecting the circle.\n\nSo, parametrize BD as x from 0 to 0.5, y=0. The circle equation is (x - 0.398)^2 + (y - 0.2293)^2 ≈ 0.251^2 ≈ 0.063.

Apollonius's theorem for the median from B to AC (midpoint E) would involve BE. But D is the midpoint of BC, so BD is not a median but a segment from B to midpoint of BC, which is just half of BC. Therefore, BD should be 0.5 if BC=1.\n\nBut earlier calculation using Law of Cosines and coordinates gave BD≈0.6965, which is incorrect. Therefore, my coordinate assignment was wrong.\n\nThis suggests a critical error in my initial coordinate setup. Let me reassess.\n\nIf BC is length 1, then midpoint D is at distance 0.5 from B. Therefore, BD=0.5. However, in triangle ABC with angles 84°, 60°, 36°, sides are determined by Law of Sines:\n\nBC = a = 2R sin 84°\n\nAB = c = 2R sin 36°\n\nAC = b = 2R sin 60°\n\nIf we set BC=1, then 2R sin84°=1 => R=1/(2 sin84°).

But in my coordinate system earlier, I placed B at (0,0), C at (1,0), and computed coordinates of A based on angles, leading to BD≈0.6965, which contradicts BD=0.5.\n\nThis inconsistency arises because placing B at (0,0), C at (1,0), and angle at B=60°, the coordinates of A are not compatible with BC=1 and BD=0.5. Therefore, my coordinate assignment was flawed.\n\nThis suggests that assigning coordinates while maintaining BC=1 and angles given requires a different approach.\n\nLet me correct this.\n\nLet me place point B at (0,0), point C at (1,0), so BC=1. We need to find coordinates of A such that angle at A is 84°, angle at B is 60°, angle at C is 36°.\n\nUsing Law of Sines:\n\nAB / sin36° = BC / sin84° => AB = BC * sin36° / sin84° ≈1 *0.5878/0.9945≈0.5910\n\nAC / sin60° = BC / sin84° => AC= BC * sin60° / sin84°≈1 *0.8660/0.9945≈0.8707\n\nNow, coordinates of A can be found using Law of Cosines or by using trilinear coordinates.\n\nLet me compute coordinates of A.\n\nIn triangle ABC, with B at (0,0), C at (1,0), and A at (x,y).
