There are two circles, ω₁ and ω₂. ω₁ has radius 6 and is centered at point A. ω₂ has radius 15 and is centered somewhere such that ω₁ is internally tangent to ω₂ at point B. So, since they're internally tangent, the center of ω₂ must be along the line connecting A and B, right? And the distance between the centers would be the difference in radii. Since ω₁ has radius 6 and ω₂ has radius 15, the distance between A and the center of ω₂ (let's call that point O) should be 15 - 6 = 9 units. So OA = 9, and OB = 15 because that's the radius of ω₂. Point B is the point of tangency.\n\nThen, points C and D are on ω₂ such that BC is a diameter of ω₂. Since BC is a diameter, that means the center of ω₂, which is O, must be the midpoint of BC. So BO = OC = 15 units each. Also, BC is perpendicular to AD. So line AD is perpendicular to diameter BC. \n\nNext, there's a rectangle EFGH inscribed in ω₁. So all four vertices E, F, G, H lie on ω₁. The rectangle is oriented such that EF is perpendicular to BC. Since BC is a diameter of ω₂, which is larger, and EF is perpendicular to BC. Also, C is closer to GH than to EF, meaning that GH is on the side closer to C. Similarly, D is closer to FG than to EH, so FG is closer to D. \n\nMoreover, the areas of triangles DGF and CHG are equal. We need to find the area of rectangle EFGH, which will be expressed as a fraction m/n, and then compute m + n where m and n are coprime.",

So point B is at (-15, 0) and point C is at (15, 0). Then, the center A of ω₁ is somewhere along the line connecting O and B because ω₁ is internally tangent to ω₂ at B. Wait, no. Wait, internal tangency at B implies that point B is on both circles. So ω₁ is centered at A, radius 6, and ω₂ is centered at O, radius 15. Since they are tangent at B, the distance between A and O must be equal to 15 - 6 = 9. So OA = 9. And point B is the point of tangency, so it lies along the line OA. So if O is at (0,0), then A is 9 units away from O towards point B. But BC is a diameter of ω₂, which is along the x-axis from (-15,0) to (15,0). Wait, but if OA is 9 units, and point B is the point where ω₁ and ω₂ are tangent, then point B must lie on OA. But OA is along the line from O to A, which is 9 units. However, BC is a diameter of ω₂, which is along the x-axis. So if O is at (0,0), BC is along the x-axis. Then OA must be along the x-axis as well because the circles are tangent at B, which lies on OA. Therefore, point A is 9 units away from O along the x-axis. So coordinates would be O(0,0), A(9,0). Then, ω₁ is centered at (9,0) with radius 6, and ω₂ is centered at (0,0) with radius 15. The point of tangency B is on the line OA. Since OA is 9 units, and ω₁ has radius 6, then point B is 6 units from A towards O. So coordinates of B would be (9 - 6, 0) = (3,0). Wait, but ω₂ has radius 15, so point B should also be 15 units from O(0,0). Let me check: distance from O to B is sqrt((3 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2) = 3, but ω₂ has radius 15. That can't be.

Ah! That makes sense. So O to A is 9 units, A to B is 6 units, so O to B is 15 units, which is the radius of ω₂. Therefore, coordinates: O at (0,0), A at (9,0), B at (15,0). Wait, but then OA is 9 units, AB is 6 units, so OB is 15 units. Yes, that works. So ω₂ is centered at O(0,0) with radius 15, ω₁ is centered at A(9,0) with radius 6, tangent to ω₂ at B(15,0).

Since BC is a diameter, then C must be diametrically opposite to B on ω₂. The center O is the midpoint of BC. So midpoint of BC is O(0,0). Therefore, coordinates of C can be found. If B is (15,0), then midpoint is ( (15 + x)/2 , (0 + y)/2 ) = (0,0). Therefore, (15 + x)/2 = 0 => x = -15, and (0 + y)/2 = 0 => y = 0. Therefore, point C is (-15,0). So BC is from (15,0) to (-15,0), which is the diameter along the x-axis. Then, AD is perpendicular to BC. BC is along the x-axis, so AD must be vertical, along the y-axis. Since point A is at (9,0), line AD is vertical, so D is a point on ω₂ along the vertical line through A. Wait, AD is perpendicular to BC, which is horizontal, so AD is vertical. Therefore, point D is on ω₂, which is centered at O(0,0) with radius 15, lying along the vertical line through A(9,0). So the vertical line through A is x = 9.

If EF is on the left and GH on the right, then C is closer to EF (left side) than to GH (right side). So that contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, maybe EF is on the right and GH on the left? But that would be inconsistent with the usual labeling of rectangles. Wait, EFGH is a rectangle, so the order of the letters matters. Typically, rectangles are labeled in order, so EFGH would have sides EF, FG, GH, HE. If EF is vertical, then FG would be horizontal. So starting from E, going to F (vertical), then to G (horizontal), then to H (vertical down), then to E (horizontal back). So if EF is vertical on the right side, then FG is horizontal towards the left, GH is vertical down on the left, and HE is horizontal back to E. But in that case, GH would be on the left.

Therefore, if E is (9 + a, b), then G would be (9 - a, -b), making the midpoint ((9 + a + 9 - a)/2, (b + (-b))/2) = (9,0). Similarly, F and H would be (9 + a, -b) and (9 - a, b).

The height is the vertical distance from D(9,12) to the line GF (which is y = -b). So height is 12 - (-b) = 12 + b.\n\nTherefore, area of triangle DGF is 1/2 * base * height = 1/2 * 2a * (12 + b) = a*(12 + b).\n\nSimilarly, triangle CHG: points C(-15,0), H(9 - a, b), G(9 - a, -b)\n\nLet me compute its area. Again, points H and G have the same x-coordinate (9 - a), so the line HG is vertical from (9 - a, b) to (9 - a, -b), length 2b. The base is HG with length 2b, and the height is the horizontal distance from point C(-15,0) to the line HG (which is x = 9 - a). The distance is | -15 - (9 - a) | = | -24 + a | = |a - 24|. Therefore, area is 1/2 * base * height = 1/2 * 2b * |a - 24| = b*|a - 24|.\n\nBut since a and b are positive (they are half the sides of the rectangle), and given that the rectangle is inside ω₁ centered at (9,0) with radius 6, the maximum possible value for a is 6 (if the rectangle is a horizontal line), but since it's a rectangle, a must be less than 6.
