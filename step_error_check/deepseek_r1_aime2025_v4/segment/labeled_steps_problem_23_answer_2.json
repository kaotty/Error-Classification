  "problem": "From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $ N $ cents, where $ N $ is a positive integer. He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.",

The greedy algorithm here is choosing the largest coin possible at each step without exceeding N. But sometimes, like in the example of 42 cents, using smaller coins might actually result in fewer total coins. My task is to find all N where this isn't the case—where the greedy approach actually gives the minimal number of coins.",

Therefore, 25 +10 +7*1 -4*10 -2*1=0. So 25 -3*10 +5*1=0. So 25=3*10 -5*1. But 25 is not equal to 3*10 -5*1. 3*10 is 30, minus 5*1 is 25. So 30-5=25. So 25=30-5. So substituting 25 with 3*10 -5*1. So replacing 25 +10 +7*1 with 4*10 +2*1 is equivalent to replacing 25 with 3*10 -5*1, then adding the original 10 +7*1.

The key is that replacing a 25-cent coin with three 10s and subtracting five 1s (since 25 = 30 -5) allows us to use more 10s and fewer 1s. But when does this substitution lead to a net gain in coins?\n\nIn this case, replacing 1 coin (25) with 3 coins (10s) but removing 5 coins (1s). So net change: 3 -1 -5 = -3 coins. So total coins saved: 3. So this substitution is beneficial when the number of 1s saved is more than the number of 10s added.\n\nBut in general, when can we replace a 25 with some 10s and 1s to get a better coin count?\n\nSimilarly, maybe replacing a 10 with some 1s? But replacing a 10 with 10*1s would increase the coin count by 9, which is worse. So that's not helpful. So the only beneficial substitution is replacing higher coins with lower ones in a way that reduces total coins.\n\nBut replacing 25 with 10s and 1s can sometimes help if the number of 1s saved is more than the number of 10s added.",

Each such triplet corresponds to a unique N. However, the same N can be represented in different ways if it allows for multiple combinations of q, d, r. But according to the greedy decomposition, each N has a unique triplet (q,d,r). Therefore, the total number of bad N is indeed the number of such triplets, but this must be <=1000.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's9720, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a mistake in the mathematical derivation.\n\nThe root cause is that when we derived the formula for bad N, we considered all possible q>=1 and r=5-9, but many of these combinations result in N>1000, hence the floor functions and the upper limit of q=40.\n\nBut when q=40, M(q)=1000 -25*40=1000 -1000=0. Then for r=5-9, M(q)-r= -5 to -9, which is negative. Therefore, floor((M(q)-r)/10)=floor(negative number), which is negative. Then floor((M(q)-r)/10) +1=0 or negative +1, which is<=0. But since d can't be negative, the number of terms is0.\n\nTherefore, for q=40 and r=5-9: floor((0 -r)/10) +1=floor(-r/10) +1= -1 +1=0. Therefore, no terms.\n\nSimilarly, for q approaching40, many terms will be0.\n\nTherefore, the sum is not9720, but much less.\n\nTherefore, the previous approach of summing over q=1 to40 and r=5-9 is correct, but the earlier calculation incorrectly included q up to40 without considering that for larger q, M(q)=1000 -25q becomes small, leading to negative numbers.\n\nTherefore, we need to adjust the upper limit of q for each r.\n\nSpecifically, for each r=5-9, the maximum q such that25*q +r <=1000.\n\n25*q +r <=1000 →q <=(1000 -r)/25.\n\nFor r=5: q<=995/25=39.8→q<=39\n\nFor r=6: q<=994/25=39.76→q<=39\n\nSimilarly up to r=9: q<=991/25=39.64→q<=39.\n\nTherefore, q can only go up to39 for r=5-9.\n\nSimilarly, for q=40:\n\n25*40 +r=1000 +r>1000, so invalid.\n\nTherefore, q ranges from1 to39 for r=5-9.\n\nTherefore, earlier mistake was including q=40, which contributes nothing.\n\nThus, correct q_max=39.\n\nBut even q=39:\n\nFor r=5:25*39 +5=975 +5=980.
