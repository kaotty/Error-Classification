Hmm, non-convex and simple, so it doesn't intersect itself. The problem gives some conditions about the areas of triangles formed with vertex A1 and consecutive vertices, the cosine of their angles, and the total perimeter. We need to find A1A2 + A1A11 expressed in a certain form and then sum the constants m, n, p, q.",

      "reasoning_step": "So, starting with the triangles. Each triangle A_iA1A_{i+1} has area 1 and angle at A1 with cosine 12/13. Since all these angles have the same cosine, they must all be equal? Wait, cosine is 12/13, so the angle is acute. But since the polygon is non-convex, some angles might be reflex, but at vertex A1, all the angles formed by consecutive edges A1A_i and A1A_{i+1} are the same. Wait, but angle A_iA1A_{i+1} is between sides A1A_i and A1A_{i+1}. Since there are 10 such angles (from i=2 to i=10), but the polygon has 11 sides. Wait, perhaps A1 is connected to all other vertices? Wait, no, a polygon is a closed chain of edges. Wait, an 11-sided polygon has vertices A1 through A11 connected in order. So A1 is connected to A2 and A11. Then, triangles A_iA1A_{i+1} would be formed for i from 2 to 10, meaning that A1 is connected to A2, A3, ..., A11? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, in a polygon, each vertex is connected to the next. So A1 is connected to A2 and A11. Then, how are the triangles A_iA1A_{i+1} formed? For example, when i=2, triangle A2A1A3; when i=3, triangle A3A1A4; ..., up to i=10, triangle A10A1A11. So these triangles are formed by connecting A1 to each vertex A2 through A11, but the polygon itself is only the perimeter A1A2A3...A11A1. So the triangles are sub-triangles inside the polygon? But since the polygon is non-convex, some of these triangles might overlap or be outside the main polygon.\n\nBut regardless, each triangle A_iA1A_{i+1} has area 1 and angle at A1 with cosine 12/13. Let's think about the formula for the area of a triangle. The area can be given by (1/2)*ab*sinθ, where a and b are the lengths of the sides adjacent to the angle θ. Here, θ is angle A_iA1A_{i+1}, so sides A1A_i and A1A_{i+1} with angle θ between them. So for each triangle, (1/2)*A1A_i*A1A_{i+1}*sinθ = 1. And cosθ = 12/13, so sinθ = sqrt(1 - (12/13)^2) = sqrt(1 - 144/169) = sqrt(25/169) = 5/13. Therefore, sinθ = 5/13.\n\nTherefore, for each triangle, (1/2)*A1A_i*A1A_{i+1}*(5/13) = 1. Simplifying that equation:\n\n(5/26)*A1A_i*A1A_{i+1} = 1 => A1A_i*A1A_{i+1} = 26/5.\n\nSo for each i from 2 to 10, the product of A1A_i and A1A_{i+1} is 26/5. That seems like a recursive relationship. Let's denote the lengths A1A_i as x_i for i from 2 to 11. Then, for each i from 2 to 10, x_i * x_{i+1} = 26/5.",

That suggests that the sequence is a geometric sequence? Because if x_{i+1} = (26/5)/x_i, then each term is determined by the previous one. So starting from x_2, x_3 = (26/5)/x_2, x_4 = (26/5)/x_3 = x_2/(26/5) * (26/5) )? Wait, maybe not exactly. Let's see:\n\nx_2 * x_3 = 26/5\n\nx_3 * x_4 = 26/5\n\nSo substituting x_3 = (26/5)/x_2 into the second equation:\n\n(26/5)/x_2 * x_4 = 26/5 => x_4 = x_2\n\nSimilarly, x_4 * x_5 = 26/5 => x_5 = (26/5)/x_4 = (26/5)/x_2\n\nSo x_5 = x_3, which is (26/5)/x_2. Then x_6 = x_2, x_7 = x_3, etc. So the sequence alternates between x_2 and x_3. Therefore, the lengths alternate between x_2 and (26/5)/x_2.\n\nSince there are 10 terms from x_2 to x_11 (since i from 2 to 11 is 10 terms), starting with x_2, then x_3 = 26/(5x_2), x_4 = x_2, x_5 = 26/(5x_2), etc. So the pattern would be x_2, 26/(5x_2), x_2, 26/(5x_2), ..., alternating.\n\nSince there are 10 terms (i=2 to i=11), let's check how many times each term appears. Starting with x_2 (i=2), then i=3: 26/(5x_2), i=4: x_2, i=5: 26/(5x_2), ..., up to i=11. Since 10 terms, starting at i=2, ending at i=11. So the number of terms: 10 terms. Since alternating, starting with x_2, then the sequence would be x_2, 26/(5x_2), x_2, 26/(5x_2), ..., repeating. Since 10 terms, even number, so 5 pairs. Therefore, x_2 appears 5 times, and 26/(5x_2) appears 5 times.",

But regardless, perhaps we can use the Law of Cosines on each triangle A_iA1A_{i+1} to express the side A_iA_{i+1} in terms of A1A_i and A1A_{i+1}.\n\nYes, that seems promising. For each triangle A_iA1A_{i+1}, the sides are A1A_i, A1A_{i+1}, and A_iA_{i+1}. The angle at A1 is θ with cosθ = 12/13.

So that's okay.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(25x^4 -240x^2 +676) is real for any real x. So our perimeter equation is valid.\n\nSo we have:\n\nx + 26/(5x) + (9/(5x)) * sqrt(25x^4 -240x^2 +676) = 20.\n\nThis equation needs to be solved for x. Let's denote sqrt(25x^4 -240x^2 +676) as S. Then:\n\nx + 26/(5x) + (9/(5x)) * S = 20.\n\nBut S = sqrt(25x^4 -240x^2 +676). Let's see if we can express S in terms of x + 26/(5x).\n\nLet me compute (x + 26/(5x))^2:\n\n= x^2 + 2*(x)*(26/(5x)) + (26/(5x))^2\n\n= x^2 + 52/5 + 676/(25x^2)\n\nCompare this to 25x^4 -240x^2 +676 over 25x^2:",
