      "reasoning_step": "First, let's understand the setup. We're dealing with points in 3D space, but they all lie on the plane x + y + z = 75. So, effectively, we can reduce this to a 2D problem by parameterizing the plane. Maybe we can express one variable in terms of the other two. For example, z = 75 - x - y. Then, substitute z into the inequalities to get them in terms of x and y. That might simplify things.\n\nSo, substituting z = 75 - x - y into the inequalities:\n\nFirst inequality: x - yz < y - zx\n\nSecond inequality: y - zx < z - xy\n\nLet me substitute z in both inequalities.\n\nStarting with the first inequality:\n\nx - y(75 - x - y) < y - (75 - x - y)x\n\nLet me expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: x - 75y + xy + y²\n\nRight side: y - 75x + x² + xy\n\nSo, the inequality becomes:\n\nx - 75y + xy + y² < y - 75x + x² + xy\n\nSimplify both sides by subtracting xy from both sides:\n\nx - 75y + y² < y - 75x + x²\n\nBring all terms to the left side:\n\nx - 75y + y² - y + 75x - x² < 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(1 + 75)x + (-75 -1)y + y² - x² < 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n76x -76y + y² - x² < 0\n\nFactor terms:\n\nNotice that 76x -76y = 76(x - y), and y² - x² = -(x² - y²) = -(x - y)(x + y)\n\nSo, rewrite the inequality:\n\n76(x - y) - (x - y)(x + y) < 0\n\nFactor out (x - y):\n\n(x - y)(76 - (x + y)) < 0\n\nSo, the first inequality simplifies to:\n\n(x - y)(76 - (x + y)) < 0\n\nOkay, that's a nice simplification. Let's note that down.\n\nNow, moving to the second inequality: y - zx < z - xy\n\nAgain, substitute z = 75 - x - y:\n\nLeft side: y - x(75 - x - y)\n\nRight side: (75 - x - y) - x y\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: y - 75x + x² + x y\n\nRight side: 75 - x - y - x y\n\nSo, inequality becomes:\n\ny - 75x + x² + x y < 75 - x - y - x y\n\nBring all terms to the left side:\n\ny -75x + x² + x y -75 + x + y + x y < 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-75x + x) + (y + y) + x² + x y + x y -75 < 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-74x) + 2y + x² + 2x y -75 < 0",

(x + 2y -75)(x +1) <0\n\nWe need to find the region in the x-y plane where both inequalities are satisfied, and then find the area of the finite convex region among the three disjoint regions mentioned.\n\nBut first, let's analyze each inequality separately.\n\nStarting with the first inequality: (x - y)(76 -x - y) <0\n\nLet me denote S = x + y. Then, 76 - S = 76 -x - y.\n\nSo, the first inequality is (x - y)(76 - S) <0.\n\nSimilarly, the second inequality is (x + 2y -75)(x +1) <0.\n\nLet me consider the first inequality.\n\nCase 1: (x - y) >0 and (76 - S) <0\n\nCase 2: (x - y) <0 and (76 - S) >0\n\nSo, the first inequality splits into two cases:\n\nEither x > y and S >76, or x < y and S <76.\n\nSimilarly, the second inequality: (x + 2y -75)(x +1) <0\n\nLet me denote T = x + 2y -75.\n\nSo, the inequality is T*(x +1) <0.\n\nWhich splits into:\n\nEither T >0 and x +1 <0, or T <0 and x +1 >0.\n\nSo, Case A: x + 2y -75 >0 and x < -1\n\nCase B: x + 2y -75 <0 and x > -1\n\nTherefore, the second inequality requires either (T >0 and x < -1) or (T <0 and x > -1)\n\nSo, combining both inequalities, the solution set is the intersection of the regions defined by the first and second inequalities.\n\nSo, possible combinations:\n\nFirst inequality has two cases:\n\n1. x > y and S >76\n\n2. x < y and S <76\n\nSecond inequality has two cases:\n\nA. x +2y >75 and x < -1\n\nB. x +2y <75 and x > -1\n\nSo, the intersection regions would be combinations of these cases.\n\nSo, possible regions:\n\n1 and A: x > y, S >76, x +2y >75, x < -1\n\nBut if x < -1, and S =x + y >76, then y >76 -x. Since x < -1, y >76 -x >76 -(-1) =77. So y >77. But x < -1 and y >77. Then x > y would require x > y >77, but x < -1. Contradiction. So this intersection is empty.\n\n1 and B: x > y, S >76, x +2y <75, x > -1\n\nSimilarly, x > y and x + y >76, but x +2y <75. Let's see if this is possible.\n\nLet me express x + y >76 and x +2y <75.\n\nFrom x + y >76, we have y >76 -x.\n\nSubstitute into x +2y <75:\n\nx +2y <75\n\nBut y >76 -x, so substitute y =76 -x + ε, where ε >0.\n\nThen x +2(76 -x + ε) =x +152 -2x +2ε = -x +152 +2ε <75\n\nSo, -x +152 +2ε <75 → -x <75 -152 -2ε → -x < -77 -2ε → x >77 +2ε\n\nBut x >77 +2ε and x > y. But since y >76 -x, and x >77, then y >76 -77 = -1. So y > -1. But x >77 and y > -1, but x + y >76. So x >77, y > -1, x + y >76. Possible.\n\nBut x +2y <75. Let's see, with x >77 and y > -1:\n\nx +2y <75 → Since x >77, even if y is minimal (y approaches -1), x +2y >77 +2*(-1) =75. So x +2y approaches 75 from above. But the inequality is x +2y <75. But if x >77, even with y approaching -1, x +2y =77 +2*(-1)=75, but x is greater than 77, so x +2y would be greater than 75. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, this intersection is also empty.",

These results conflict.\n\nThe shoelace result suggests the area is1014, but this is for the trapezoid with vertices at(-1,38), (-1,77), (38,38), (25,25).\n\nBut according to the problem, the finite region is one of three, and the shoelace area is for an unbounded region.
