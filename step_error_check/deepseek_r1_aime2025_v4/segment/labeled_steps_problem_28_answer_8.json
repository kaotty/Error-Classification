Let's check if any previous pair repeats.\n\nLooking at pair 7: (491, 725) which appeared at k=7 and k=19? No, k=7 is (491,725), k=19 is (291,725). Not the same.\n\nPair 2: (471,825) unique so far.\n\nPair 3: (891,725) unique.\n\nPair 4: (531,925) reappears at k=8 as (731,925) no.\n\nPair 5: (411,525) reappears at k=9 as (811,525) no.\n\nPair 6: (771,325) reappears at k=14 as (371,325) no.\n\nPair 7: (491,725) reappears at k=15 as (691,725) no.\n\nPair 8: (731,925) reappears at k=20 as (331,925) no.\n\nIt seems like the pairs are not repeating within the first 20 terms. This suggests that the period, if any, is longer than 20 terms. Given that 2025 is a large number, it's impractical to compute all terms up to k=2025.\n\nHowever, notice that the problem asks for m +n mod 1000, where x_{2025}=m/n. If we can compute a_{2025} mod 1000 and b_{2025} mod 1000, then m/n mod 1000 would require knowing m and n modulo 1000, but since m and n are coprime, we can't directly assume they are the same as a_{2025} and b_{2025} modulo 1000. However, if the sequence of aₖ and bₖ modulo 1000 eventually becomes periodic, we can find the period and compute 2025 modulo the period to find the equivalent term.\n\nGiven that we've computed 20 terms without seeing a repeat, the period might be long or nonexistent. However, since the number of possible pairs (aₖ, bₖ) modulo 1000 is finite (1000*1000=1,000,000 possibilities), by the Pigeonhole Principle, eventually, a pair must repeat, leading to a cycle. However, finding this cycle would require computing until a repeat occurs, which could take up to 1,000,000 terms, which is impractical manually.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the problem expects recognizing that the sequence converges to 1/2, and due to the alternating nature, x_{odd} approaches 1/2 from below and x_{even} approaches from above. Since 2025 is odd, x_{2025} would be slightly less than 1/2. However, since the problem states that x_{2025} is a reduced fraction, this approach doesn't yield the exact answer.",
