Wait, but AF is a median? Since F is the midpoint of AB, AF connects A to F, which is the midpoint of AB, so yes, AF is a median.\n\nBut the circumcircle of DEF intersects these medians BD, AE, AF at points G, H, J. So DEF's circumcircle intersects BD at D (since D is a midpoint of BC and DEF is the medial triangle, D is a vertex of DEF, so D is on the circumcircle). Similarly, E and F are on the circumcircle. So BD is a line from B to D, which is on the circumcircle. So the intersection points of BD with the circumcircle of DEF would be D and G. Similarly, AE intersects the circumcircle at E and H, and AF intersects it at F and J.\n\nTherefore, points G, H, J are the second intersections of the medians BD, AE, AF with the circumcircle of DEF.

Therefore, angles in DEF correspond to angles in ABC but maybe rotated or something. Wait, angle at D in DEF: since DE is parallel to AB and DF is parallel to AC, then angle at D is equal to angle BAC? Wait, because DE is parallel to AB and DF is parallel to AC, so the angle between DE and DF at D would be the same as the angle between AB and AC at A, which is angle BAC = 84 degrees.

Wait, but DEF's angles are 84°, 60°, 36°, so arcs opposite those angles would be 2* those angles. Wait, no. Wait, in any triangle inscribed in a circle, the central angle over an arc is twice the opposite angle. Wait, if we have triangle DEF inscribed in a circle, then the arc DE is opposite angle F, so the central angle for arc DE is 2* angle F = 2*36°=72°, so arc DE is 72°. Similarly, arc EF would be 2* angle D = 2*84°=168°, and arc FD is 2* angle E = 2*60°=120°. Wait, but adding up 72+168+120=360°, which is correct. So arcs DE=72°, EF=168°, FD=120°.

But D is already on the circumcircle of DEF, so the other intersection point G is another point on BD and the circumcircle. But BD is the x-axis from (0,0) to (0.5,0). The circumcircle of DEF has center at approximately (0.398,0.2296) and radius ~0.251. So BD is the x-axis from (0,0) to (0.5,0). Let's parametrize BD: points on BD are (t,0) where t ranges from 0 to 0.5. We need to find another intersection point G of BD with the circumcircle, apart from D(0.5,0).\n\nSo substitute y=0 into the circumcircle equation.
