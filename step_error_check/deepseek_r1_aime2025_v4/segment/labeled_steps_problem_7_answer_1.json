For each pair, ordering them alphabetically to form a word.\n3. Sorting all six words alphabetically.\n4. Finding the probability that the last word in this sorted list contains G.\n\nTo approach this, I need to think about how the pairings affect the position of G in the sorted list. Since the words are sorted alphabetically, the last word will be the one that comes last in alphabetical order.

Then, the maximum pair would be either L's pair or K's pair, whichever is higher.\n\nBut this seems recursive. Let me formalize:\n\nLet’s denote the probability that G is in the maximum pair as P.\n\nCase 1: L is paired with K. Probability 1/11. Then the maximum pair is KL. G is not in this pair, so the probability that G is in the maximum pair is 0.\n\nCase 2: L is paired with someone else (probability 10/11). Then, the maximum pair is either L's pair or the maximum pair from the remaining letters (excluding L and its partner). Let's denote the partner of L as X.

So all the higher letters (K, J, I, H) are paired with lower letters (A, B, C, D), resulting in pairs starting with A, B, C, D, E, G. Therefore, the highest starting letter is G, so GL is the last word.\n\nTherefore, in this case, G is paired with L, and all other higher letters (K, J, I, H) are paired with lower letters, resulting in their pairs starting with lower letters. Therefore, GL becomes the last word.\n\nTherefore, it is possible for G to be in the last word. Therefore, the key is that G is paired with the highest remaining letter, and all other higher letters are paired with lower letters such that their pairs start with letters lower than G.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: What is the probability that G is paired with a letter such that all letters higher than G's partner (if G is paired with a higher letter) or all letters higher than G (if G is paired with a lower letter) are paired in a way that their pairs don't start with letters higher than G's pair.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can model it as follows:\n\nCase 1: G is paired with a letter higher than G (H, I, J, K, L). Then, the pair is GX, ordered as GX. For this pair to be the maximum, all other pairs must start with letters <= G. However, there are letters higher than G (H, I, J, K, L excluding X). These remaining letters must be paired with letters <= G such that their pairs start with <= G.\n\nBut since X is paired with G, the remaining higher letters are H, I, J, K, L excluding X. Let's say X is L. Then, remaining higher letters are H, I, J, K. These need to be paired with letters <= G (A-F). Each of these pairings would result in pairs starting with the lower letter (since H, I, J, K are higher than A-F). Therefore, the pairs would be AH, BI, CJ, DK, etc., starting with A, B, C, D, etc. These pairs would start with letters <= F (since A-F are the partners). Therefore, these pairs would start with letters <= F, which is less than G. Therefore, if G is paired with L, and the remaining higher letters (H, I, J, K) are paired with A-F, then all other pairs start with <= F, so G's pair GL starts with G, which is the highest starting letter, making GL the last word.\n\nSimilarly, if G is paired with K, then remaining higher letters are H, I, J, L. These need to be paired with A-F. Their pairs would start with A-F, which are <= F < G. Therefore, GK would be the highest starting pair, so GK would be last.\n\nSimilarly, if G is paired with J, remaining higher letters are H, I, K, L. Paired with A-F, their pairs start with <= F < G. Therefore, GJ is last.\n\nSame for GI and GH.\n\nCase 2: G is paired with a letter lower than G (A-F). Then, the pair is XG, ordered as XG. For this pair to be the maximum, all other pairs must start with letters <= X. However, since X <= F, and there are letters higher than X (G, H, I, J, K, L), which would form pairs starting with higher letters. Therefore, XG cannot be the maximum pair because there will be pairs starting with G or higher. Therefore, in this case, G cannot be part of the maximum pair.\n\nTherefore, only when G is paired with a higher letter (H-L) can G be part of the maximum pair. And in that case, for GX (X > G) to be the maximum pair, all remaining higher letters (H-L excluding X) must be paired with letters <= G, so that their pairs start with letters <= F (since they are paired with A-F), which are lower than G.\n\nTherefore, the probability that G is in the last pair is the sum over X in {H, I, J, K, L} of the probability that G is paired with X and all letters in {H, I, J, K, L} \\ {X} are paired with letters in {A, B, C, D, E, F}.\n\nSo, let's compute this probability.",
