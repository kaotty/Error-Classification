Since angles are given, maybe it's helpful to note that angle BAC is the largest angle (84°), followed by angle ABC (60°), and angle ACB (36°). So, side BC is opposite angle A, which is the largest angle, so BC should be the longest side. Similarly, sides opposite larger angles are longer. So, BC > AC > AB. Wait, angle BAC is 84°, so side BC is opposite angle A, so BC is the longest. Then angle ABC is 60°, so side AC is opposite angle B, which is 60°, so AC is next.

Wait, AF is part of the median from A to F, but since F is midpoint of AB, then AF is half of AB? Wait, no. The median from A would be to the midpoint of BC, which is D. Wait, no, in triangle ABC, the medians are from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. So median from A is AD, median from B is BE, median from C is CF. Wait, but in the problem statement, D is midpoint of BC, E midpoint of AC, F midpoint of AB.

Wait, but F is the midpoint of AB, so AF is half of AB? Hmm, no. If F is the midpoint of AB, then AF is equal to FB, each being half of AB.
