But since the problem states that x_{2025} is a reduced fraction, maybe it actually reaches 1/2 at some point? Let's check.\n\nSuppose x_k = 1/2. Then x_{k+1} = (1/2 + 2 -1)/3 = (1/2 +1)/3 = (3/2)/3 = 1/2. So 1/2 is a fixed point. So if the sequence ever reaches 1/2, it will stay there. However, starting from 25/11, which is not 1/2, and computing x₂ = 157/275 ≈ 0.5709, x₃ ≈ 0.4409, etc., oscillating around 1/2 but not reaching it. So unless it exactly reaches 1/2 at some point, which seems unlikely given the fractions involved, it will keep oscillating around 1/2 but never actually equaling it.\n\nTherefore, maybe the sequence does not reach 1/2, but approaches it as a limit. However, since all terms are rational numbers (because starting from a rational and each step involves rational operations), the terms will remain rational. Therefore, x_{2025} is a rational number, but perhaps with very large numerator and denominator.\n\nBut the problem asks for m + n mod 1000.

But earlier, we saw that GCD(471,825)=3, so reduced to 157/275.

GCD(57099,129525). Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 57099/3=19033, 129525/3=43175.

Clearly, computing this directly is impractical.\n\nBut perhaps there's a pattern in the sequence of a's and b's modulo something?\n\nSince we need m + n mod 1000, where m = a_{2025} and n = b_{2025} (assuming the fraction is reduced at each step), perhaps we can compute a_k and b_k modulo 1000 for all k up to 2025.\n\nBut tracking a_k and b_k mod 1000 requires knowing how the GCD reduction affects the values. However, since at each step, x_{k} = a_{k}/b_{k} reduced to lowest terms, then a_{k} and b_{k} are coprime. Therefore, when we compute a_{k+1} = a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k and b_{k+1} = 3 a_k b_k, then the GCD of a_{k+1} and b_{k+1} is GCD(a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k, 3 a_k b_k )\n\nBut since GCD(a_{k}, b_{k})=1, let's see:\n\nGCD(a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k, 3 a_k b_k )\n\nSince GCD(a_k, b_k)=1, any common divisor d of a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k and 3 a_k b_k must divide 3.\n\nBecause:\n\nSuppose d divides both a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k and 3 a_k b_k.\n\nSince d divides 3 a_k b_k, and GCD(a_k, b_k)=1, then d divides 3.\n\nTherefore, GCD(a_{k+1}, b_{k+1}) divides 3. Hence, when reducing x_{k+1}, we divide numerator and denominator by 1 or 3.\n\nTherefore, to track a_k and b_k modulo 1000, we can compute them step by step, keeping track of the GCD reduction factor (either 1 or 3), and adjust the numerator and denominator accordingly.\n\nThis seems feasible. Let's attempt this.\n\nInitialize:\n\na₁ =25, b₁=11\n\nSince GCD(25,11)=1, so reduced.\n\nFor k=1:\n\nCompute a₂ =25² +11² -25×11 =625 +121 -275=471\n\nb₂=3×25×11=825\n\nGCD(471,825).

Therefore, a₂=471/3=157, b₂=825/3=275\n\nNow, a₂=157, b₂=275. GCD(157,275)=1.\n\nFor k=2:\n\nCompute a₃=157² +275² -157×275=24649 +75625 -43175=100274 -43175=57099\n\nb₃=3×157×275=3×43175=129525\n\nGCD(57099,129525).

      "reasoning_step": "a₂=96/3=32 mod125/3? Wait, division modulo 125 requires multiplying by the inverse of 3 mod125.\n\nSince 3×42=126≡1 mod125, so inverse of3 mod125 is42.\n\nThus, a₂=(96 mod125)*42 mod125.\n\n96×42=4032. 4032 ÷125=32*125=4000, 4032-4000=32.

So b₃=25 mod125.\n\nCheck GCD(99,25). GCD(99,25)=1. So no division needed. a₃=99, b₃=25 mod125.\n\nStep3:\n\nCompute a₄=(99² +25² -99×25) mod125.\n\n99²=9801 mod125: 9801 ÷125=78×125=9750, 9801-9750=51.

Because when we compute a_{k+1} and b_{k+1}, we might divide by 3, but here, modulo 125, if there's a factor of 3, we need to multiply by the inverse of3 mod125. However, if there's another common divisor, like 2 in this case, but since in reality, GCD(a_k,b_k)=1, any common divisor modulo 125 must divide the GCD computed during the reduction step.\n\nBut perhaps this approach is getting too convoluted. Maybe instead, since we are tracking the reduced a_k and b_k, which are coprime, we need to ensure that in our modulo 125 computation, we also track the division by the GCD at each step.\n\nBut this requires knowing whether at each step, the GCD is 1 or 3. However, modulo 125, since 3 and 125 are coprime, dividing by 3 is possible via multiplication by inverse.\n\nBut in step3, we computed a₄=76, b₄=50 mod125.

Therefore, when computing modulo 125, we need to check if 3 divides both a_{k+1} and b_{k+1}. Since b_{k+1} is always divisible by3 (because b_{k+1}=3 a_k b_k), so if a_{k+1} is divisible by3, then GCD is3, else GCD is1.\n\nTherefore, in modulo125 computation:\n\nAt each step, compute a_{k+1} and b_{k+1} as:\n\na_{k+1} = (a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k) mod125\n\nb_{k+1} = (3 a_k b_k) mod125\n\nThen, check if a_{k+1} ≡0 mod3.
