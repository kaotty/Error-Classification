So, for f(x) = sin(7π·sin(5x)) to be zero, the argument inside the sine function, which is 7π·sin(5x), must be an integer multiple of π. So, mathematically, that would mean:\n\n7π·sin(5x) = kπ, where k is an integer.\n\nDividing both sides by π gives:\n\n7·sin(5x) = k\n\nSo, sin(5x) = k/7. But since sin(5x) must lie between -1 and 1, k/7 must also lie in that interval. Therefore, k can be any integer such that -7 ≤ k ≤ 7. But since sin(5x) ranges from -1 to 1, k can be from -7 to 7, but let's check:\n\nIf k is from -7 to 7, inclusive, then k/7 ranges from -1 to 1, which matches the range of sin(5x).

But open interval (0, 2π) excludes 0 and 2π, so only x = π. So n = 1. Then, the graph is tangent to x-axis if derivative is zero there. So f(x) = sin(sin(x)), derivative is cos(sin(x)) * cos(x).

Each contributes 10 solutions. Then k = -7 and 7 contribute 5 each. So total is 13*10 + 2*5 = 130 +10 =140. So n=140.\n\nBut 140 zeros in the interval 0 to 2π? That seems plausible? Let's see, the function f(x) = sin(7π·sin(5x)) oscillates quite rapidly because of the sin(5x) inside, multiplied by 7π. So sin(5x) has frequency 5/(2π), and then multiplied by 7π, making the argument of the sine function 7π sin(5x), which varies between -7π and 7π. So the sine function sin(7π sin(5x)) will oscillate rapidly as x changes, because sin(5x) is changing with x. So each time sin(5x) crosses a multiple of 1/7, the argument crosses a multiple of π, leading to a zero. Given that sin(5x) crosses each level twice per period, and there are 5 periods in 0 to 2π, so 10 crossings per k. So yeah, 140 zeros. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the second part is to find t, the number of these zeros where the graph is tangent to the x-axis. That happens when both f(x) = 0 and f'(x) = 0. So, the function has a double root there, meaning the graph just touches the x-axis and turns around. So, we need to find the values of x where sin(7π sin(5x)) = 0 and the derivative is also zero.\n\nSo, let's compute the derivative f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx [sin(7π sin(5x))] = cos(7π sin(5x)) * 7π * cos(5x) * 5\n\nSo, f'(x) = 35π cos(7π sin(5x)) cos(5x)\n\nSo, for f(x) = 0 and f'(x) = 0, we need both:\n\n1. sin(7π sin(5x)) = 0, which implies 7π sin(5x) = kπ => sin(5x) = k/7, as before.\n\n2. cos(7π sin(5x)) cos(5x) = 0.\n\nBut since sin(7π sin(5x)) = 0, then 7π sin(5x) = kπ, so sin(5x) = k/7. Then, cos(7π sin(5x)) = cos(kπ) = (-1)^k.\n\nTherefore, substituting into the derivative condition:\n\n(-1)^k * cos(5x) = 0.\n\nSo, cos(5x) = 0.\n\nTherefore, the conditions for tangency are:\n\nsin(5x) = k/7 and cos(5x) = 0.",
