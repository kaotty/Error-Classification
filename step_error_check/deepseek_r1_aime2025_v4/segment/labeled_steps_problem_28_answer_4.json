Let's try that.\n\nStarting with x1 = 25/11.\n\nCompute x2: (1/3)(25/11 + 1/(25/11) - 1) = (1/3)(25/11 + 11/25 - 1). Let's compute each part:\n\n25/11 is approximately 2.2727, 11/25 is 0.44, and subtracting 1 gives 2.2727 + 0.44 - 1 = 1.7127. Then multiply by 1/3: approximately 0.5709. But let's do exact fractions.\n\n25/11 + 11/25 = (25*25 + 11*11)/(11*25) = (625 + 121)/275 = 746/275. Then subtract 1: 746/275 - 275/275 = (746 - 275)/275 = 471/275. Multiply by 1/3: 471/(275*3) = 471/825. Simplify 471/825. Let's see, GCD of 471 and 825. Factors of 471: 3*157. 825: 25*33 = 25*3*11. So GCD is 3. Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 157/275. So x2 = 157/275.\n\nOkay, x2 is 157/275. Now x3 = (1/3)(157/275 + 1/(157/275) -1). Compute 1/(157/275) = 275/157. So:\n\n157/275 + 275/157 - 1. Let's compute:\n\nConvert to a common denominator. Let's see, denominators 275 and 157. Are these coprime? 275 is 5^2 * 11, and 157 is prime. So yes, coprime. Common denominator is 275*157.\n\nSo:\n\n157/275 = (157^2)/(275*157)\n275/157 = (275^2)/(275*157)\n1 = (275*157)/(275*157)\n\nSo numerator becomes 157^2 + 275^2 - 275*157. Let's compute that:\n\n157^2 = 24649\n275^2 = 75625\n275*157 = 275*(150 +7) = 275*150 + 275*7 = 41250 + 1925 = 43175\n\nSo numerator: 24649 + 75625 - 43175 = (24649 + 75625) = 100274 - 43175 = 57099\n\nTherefore, numerator is 57099, denominator is 275*157 = 43175\n\nSo x3 = (1/3)*(57099/43175) = 57099/(3*43175) = 57099/129525",

Then:\n\nx_{k+1} = (x_k +1/x_k -1)/3\n\nExpress in terms of y_k:\n\nx_{k+1} = ( (1/2 + y_k) + 1/(1/2 + y_k) -1 ) /3\n\nSimplify 1/(1/2 + y_k) = 2/(1 + 2y_k) = 2(1 -2y_k +4y_k^2 -8y_k^3 +...) assuming |2y_k| <1.\n\nSo approximate:\n\nx_{k+1} ≈ [1/2 + y_k +2(1 -2y_k +4y_k^2) -1]/3\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n1/2 + y_k +2 -4y_k +8y_k^2 -1 = (1/2 +2 -1) + (y_k -4y_k) +8y_k^2 = 3/2 -3y_k +8y_k^2\n\nMultiply by 1/3:\n\n1/2 - y_k + (8/3)y_k^2\n\nBut x_{k+1} =1/2 + y_{k+1}, so:\n\n1/2 + y_{k+1} ≈1/2 - y_k + (8/3)y_k^2\n\nTherefore, y_{k+1} ≈ -y_k + (8/3)y_k^2\n\nIf y_k is small, then y_{k+1} ≈ -y_k.

However, as k increases, if y_k becomes small, then the linear term dominates, leading to alternating signs and decreasing magnitude. But how quickly does y_k decrease?\n\nGiven that y_{k+1} = -y_k + (8/3)y_k^2, if y_k is small, then y_{k+1} ≈ -y_k, so magnitude stays roughly the same but alternates sign. But with the quadratic term, if y_k is positive, then y_{k+1} ≈ -y_k + positive term, so if y_k is positive, y_{k+1} is less negative than -y_k. If y_k is negative, y_{k+1} ≈ -y_k + (8/3)y_k^2.

Given that, it's unlikely that the sequence repeats or stabilizes, but instead, each term is a new fraction in reduced form.\n\nGiven the problem asks for x_{2025}, which is a very large term, it's impractical to compute it directly. Therefore, there must be a pattern or formula that allows us to determine m and n modulo 1000 without computing the entire fraction.\n\nThe question asks for m + n mod 1000, where m/n is x_{2025} in reduced form. Since m and n are coprime, if we can find m mod 1000 and n mod 1000, we can compute (m +n) mod 1000.\n\nHowever, to find m and n modulo 1000, we need to understand how the numerators and denominators behave modulo 1000. Given the recurrence relations for n_k and d_k:\n\nn_{k+1} = (d_k^2 +n_k^2 -d_k n_k)/3 mod 1000\n\nd_{k+1} = (d_k n_k) mod 1000\n\nBut since we're dealing with modular arithmetic, we need to compute each term modulo 1000, but we have to divide by 3 in the numerator recurrence. To do this, we need to multiply by the modular inverse of 3 modulo 1000. The inverse of 3 modulo 1000 is a number x such that 3x ≡1 mod 1000. Testing 3*667=2001≡1 mod 1000. So inverse of 3 modulo 1000 is 667.\n\nTherefore, the recurrence modulo 1000 becomes:\n\nn_{k+1} ≡ (d_k^2 +n_k^2 -d_k n_k)*667 mod 1000\n\nd_{k+1} ≡ (d_k n_k) mod 1000\n\nThis is manageable. We can compute n_k and d_k modulo 1000 for each k up to 2025 using these recurrence relations.\n\nHowever, since the modulo operation can introduce cycles, we can look for a period in the sequence of (n_k mod 1000, d_k mod 1000) pairs. Once a pair repeats, the sequence will cycle.\n\nGiven that there are 1000 possible remainders for n_k and 1000 for d_k, there are at most 1000*1000=1,000,000 possible pairs. Thus, the period can't exceed 1,000,000. Since 2025 is much smaller than a million, unless the period is shorter, we might have to compute all terms up to 2025.

      "reasoning_step": "Wait, in our computations, the cycle at position 6 (k=9) gives n=633 and d=575. So x_{2025}=633/575. However, we need to ensure that this fraction is in reduced form. As computed earlier, GCD(633,575)=1, so yes. Therefore, m=633, n=575, m +n=633+575=1208. 1208 mod 1000=208.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when m +n is divided by 1000 is 208.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{208}\n",
