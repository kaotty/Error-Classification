Let me let side AB lie along the x-axis. Let me denote AB as length c, BC as length a, and AC as length b.

Let me denote the circumradius of ABC as R. Then a = 2R sin A, etc. But maybe instead, let's assign AB to be of length 1 for simplicity. Then c = AB = 1.

Therefore, the perpendicular bisector is vertical, passing through midpoint (0.654,1.4645). So equation is x = 0.654.\n\nNow compute perpendicular bisector of DF.\n\nFirst, compute midpoint of DF.\n\nMidpoint DF: ((1.154 + 1)/2, (1.4645 + 0)/2 ) = (1.077, 0.73225).\n\nSlope of DF: from D(1.154,1.4645) to F(1,0).\n\nSlope = (0 - 1.4645)/(1 - 1.154) = (-1.4645)/(-0.154) ≈ 9.496.\n\nTherefore, slope of DF is approximately 9.496.\n\nTherefore, the perpendicular bisector slope is the negative reciprocal: -1/9.496 ≈ -0.105.\n\nSo equation of perpendicular bisector of DF: passes through midpoint (1.077, 0.73225) with slope -0.105.\n\nEquation: y - 0.73225 = -0.105(x - 1.077)\n\nNow, intersection of perpendicular bisectors x = 0.654 and this line gives the circumcircle center.\n\nSubstitute x = 0.654 into the second equation:\n\ny - 0.73225 = -0.105*(0.654 - 1.077) = -0.105*(-0.423) ≈ 0.0444\n\nTherefore, y ≈ 0.73225 + 0.0444 ≈ 0.77665\n\nTherefore, circumcircle center is approximately (0.654, 0.77665). Let's check if this is equidistant from D, E, F.\n\nCompute distance from center to D:\n\nCenter (0.654, 0.77665) to D(1.154,1.4645):\n\nΔx = 1.154 - 0.654 = 0.5\n\nΔy = 1.4645 - 0.77665 ≈ 0.68785\n\nDistance squared: 0.5² + 0.68785² ≈ 0.25 + 0.473 ≈ 0.723\n\nDistance ≈ sqrt(0.723) ≈ 0.85\n\nDistance to E(0.154,1.4645):\n\nΔx = 0.154 - 0.654 = -0.5\n\nΔy = 1.4645 - 0.77665 ≈ 0.68785\n\nSame distance squared: (-0.5)^2 + 0.68785^2 ≈ 0.25 + 0.473 ≈ 0.723, same as above.\n\nDistance to F(1,0):\n\nΔx = 1 - 0.654 = 0.346\n\nΔy = 0 - 0.77665 ≈ -0.77665\n\nDistance squared: 0.346² + (-0.77665)^2 ≈ 0.1197 + 0.6032 ≈ 0.7229 ≈ same as above.\n\nSo radius is approximately 0.85 units. Therefore, circumcircle of DEF has center at approximately (0.654, 0.77665) and radius ≈0.85.\n\nNow, need to find points G, H, J where BD, AE, AF intersect the circumcircle again.",

Considering rounding errors, this checks out.\n\nTherefore, BG * BD = power of B ≈1.6885.\n\nSimilarly, we can compute BG ≈1.001, BD≈1.692, so BG≈0.592*BD (since t≈0.592 earlier). So BG≈0.592BD.\n\nBut how does this help us find arc GD?\n\nAlternatively, since we have the central angles for the arcs, perhaps we can relate the chord lengths to the arcs.\n\nChord length = 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle.\n\nFor arc GD, chord length GD can be computed from coordinates.\n\nDistance GD: between G(1.499,0.867) and D(1.154,1.4645).\n\nΔx=1.499-1.154≈0.345\n\nΔy=0.867-1.4645≈-0.5975\n\nDistance GD≈sqrt(0.345² + (-0.5975)^2)≈sqrt(0.119 +0.357)≈sqrt(0.476)≈0.690\n\nChord length GD≈0.690, radius≈0.85.\n\nChord length formula: chord = 2r sin(θ/2)\n\nThus, 0.690≈2*0.85*sin(θ/2)\n\n=> sin(θ/2)≈0.690/(1.7)≈0.405\n\nThus, θ/2≈23.9°, so θ≈47.8°, approximately 48°.\n\nTherefore, arc GD≈48°, similarly other arcs can be computed.\n\nBut DE is known as72°, so remaining arcs:\n\nTotal circle 360°, so GD + DE + EH + HJ + JF + FG =360°\n\nFrom approximate calculations:\n\nGD≈48°, DE=72°, then EH, HJ, JF, FG need to sum to 240°.\n\nBut this approach is getting too approximate and may not lead to an exact answer.\n\nGiven that the problem is from a competition, likely there's a synthetic solution with exact answer, probably an integer.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: angles of ABC are 84°, 60°, 36°, which are multiples of 6°, suggesting the final answer might be a multiple of 6°.\n\nThe required sum is DE + 2*HJ + 3*FG.\n\nGiven DE is72°, if HJ and FG are also multiples of 6°, say HJ=24°, FG= something else, then total sum would be 72 + 2*24 +3*FG.\n\nBut need to find exact measures.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nSince DEF is the medial triangle, its circumcircle is the nine-point circle of ABC. The nine-point circle passes through midpoints of sides, feet of altitudes, and midpoints of segments from each vertex to the orthocenter.\n\nBut in this problem, we're dealing with midpoints D, E, F, so DEF is part of the nine-point circle.\n\nThe nine-point circle has several properties, one of which is that it is centrally symmetric with respect to the Euler line's midpoint.\n\nBut perhaps not helpful here.",

Coordinates of H:\n\nx=0.077*0.142≈0.0109,\n\ny=0.733*0.142≈0.104.\n\nThus, H≈(0.0109,0.104).\n\nSimilarly, find J on AF.\n\nAF from A(0,0) to F(0.5,0).\n\nParametric equations:\n\nx(r)=0.5r,\n\ny(r)=0,\n\nwhere r=0 at A and r=1 at F.\n\nFind intersection J ≠ F.\n\nSubstitute into circumcircle equation:\n\n(0.5r -0.327)^2 + (0 -0.3887)^2 ≈0.1806.\n\nCompute:\n\n(0.5r -0.327)^2 +0.151≈0.1806\n\nThus,\n\n(0.5r -0.327)^2≈0.0296\n\nTake square roots:\n\n0.5r -0.327≈±0.172\n\nThus,\n\n0.5r≈0.327±0.172\n\nTwo solutions:\n\n0.5r≈0.327+0.172≈0.499 => r≈0.998≈1 (point F)\n\n0.5r≈0.327-0.172≈0.155 => r≈0.310\n\nThus, J at r≈0.310:\n\nx=0.5*0.310≈0.155,\n\ny=0.\n\nThus, J≈(0.155,0).\n\nNow, we have points:\n\nG≈(0.754,0.426),\n\nH≈(0.0109,0.104),\n\nJ≈(0.155,0),\n\nD≈(0.577,0.733),\n\nE≈(0.077,0.733),\n\nF≈(0.5,0).\n\nNow, compute arcs DE, HJ, FG.\n\nFirst, DE is from D(0.577,0.733) to E(0.077,0.733). Since both have the same y-coordinate, this arc is horizontal. The central angle can be calculated.\n\nCenter of circumcircle is≈(0.327,0.3887).\n\nVector from center to D: (0.577 -0.327,0.733 -0.3887)=(0.25,0.3443)\n\nVector from center to E: (0.077 -0.327,0.733 -0.3887)=(-0.25,0.3443)\n\nAngle between these vectors:\n\nDot product:0.25*(-0.25) +0.3443*0.3443≈-0.0625 +0.1185≈0.056\n\nMagnitudes:\n\n|D| = sqrt(0.25² +0.3443²)=sqrt(0.0625 +0.1185)=sqrt(0.181)=0.425\n\nSimilarly, |E|=0.425\n\nThus, cosθ=0.056/(0.425²)=0.056/0.1806≈0.3097\n\nThus, θ≈72°, which matches previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, arc DE=72°.\n\nNext, arc HJ: from H≈(0.0109,0.104) to J≈(0.155,0).\n\nVectors from center≈(0.327,0.3887):\n\nVector to H: (0.0109 -0.327,0.104 -0.3887)=(-0.3161,-0.2847)\n\nVector to J: (0.155 -0.327,0 -0.3887)=(-0.172,-0.3887)\n\nCompute angle between these vectors.\n\nDot product:\n\n(-0.3161)(-0.172) + (-0.2847)(-0.3887)≈0.0543 +0.1107≈0.165\n\nMagnitudes:\n\n|H|=sqrt((-0.3161)^2 + (-0.2847)^2)=sqrt(0.0999 +0.0811)=sqrt(0.181)=0.425\n\n|J|=sqrt((-0.172)^2 + (-0.3887)^2)=sqrt(0.0296 +0.1511)=sqrt(0.1807)=0.425\n\nThus, cosθ=0.165/(0.425²)=0.165/0.1806≈0.913\n\nThus, θ≈24°, so arc HJ≈24°.\n\nFinally, arc FG: from F≈(0.5,0) to G≈(0.754,0.426).\n\nVectors from center≈(0.327,0.3887):\n\nVector to F: (0.5 -0.327,0 -0.3887)=(0.173,-0.3887)\n\nVector to G: (0.754 -0.327,0.426 -0.3887)=(0.427,0.0373)\n\nCompute angle between these vectors.\n\nDot product:\n\n0.173*0.427 + (-0.3887)*0.0373≈0.0739 -0.0145≈0.0594\n\nMagnitudes:\n\n|F|=sqrt(0.173² + (-0.3887)^2)=sqrt(0.030 +0.151)=sqrt(0.181)=0.425\n\n|G|=sqrt(0.427² +0.0373^2)=sqrt(0.182 +0.0014)=sqrt(0.1834)=0.428≈0.425 (approximation due to rounding)\n\nThus, cosθ=0.0594/(0.425²)=0.0594/0.1806≈0.328\n\nThus, θ≈71°, so arc FG≈71°.\n\nBut since the total circle is 360°, let's verify:\n\narc DE=72°, arc HJ≈24°, arc FG≈71°,",
