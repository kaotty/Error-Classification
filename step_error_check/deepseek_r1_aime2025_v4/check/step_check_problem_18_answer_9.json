Wait, actually, each unit square has four sides, but when they're adjacent, they share sides. So, in total, for a 2x2 grid, the number of horizontal segments is 3 rows of 2 segments each, totaling 6 horizontal segments. Similarly, vertical segments are 3 columns of 2 segments each, totaling 6 vertical segments. So altogether, 12 segments, which matches the problem statement.\n\nEach of these 12 segments can be colored red or blue. But the constraint is that each of the four unit squares must have exactly two red and two blue sides. So, for each square, among its four edges (top, right, bottom, left), exactly two are red and two are blue.\n\nBut since edges are shared between squares, coloring one edge affects two squares (except for the edges on the border of the grid). For example, the middle horizontal edge is part of the top square and the bottom square in its column. Similarly, the middle vertical edge is part of the left and right squares in its row.\n\nSo, we need to assign colors to the edges such that each square has exactly two red and two blue edges.

H2_1 + V2_2 + H3_1 + V1_2 = 2\n4. H2_2 + V3_2 + H3_2 + V2_2 = 2\n\nNotice that variables H2_1 and H2_2 appear in two equations each (equations 1 and 3 for H2_1; equations 2 and 4 for H2_2). Similarly, V2_1 appears in equations 1 and 2; V2_2 appears in equations 3 and 4.\n\nOther variables appear only once: H1_1, H1_2, H3_1, H3_2, V1_1, V1_2, V3_1, V3_2.\n\nSo, perhaps we can express variables H1_1, H1_2, H3_1, H3_2, V1_1, V1_2, V3_1, V3_2 in terms of the others.\n\nLet me attempt to solve the system step by step.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\nH1_1 + V1_1 = 2 - V2_1 - H2_1\n\nSince H1_1 and V1_1 are variables (0 or 1), the right-hand side must be 0, 1, or 2. However, since V2_1 and H2_1 are also 0 or 1, 2 - V2_1 - H2_1 can be 2 - 0 - 0 = 2, 2 - 0 - 1 = 1, 2 - 1 - 0 = 1, or 2 - 1 - 1 = 0.\n\nTherefore, H1_1 + V1_1 can be 0, 1, or 2. But since H1_1 and V1_1 are each 0 or 1, their sum can be 0, 1, or 2. So, depending on V2_1 and H2_1, H1_1 and V1_1 are constrained.\n\nSimilarly, equation 2:\n\nH1_2 + V3_1 = 2 - V2_1 - H2_2\n\nSame logic applies here.\n\nEquation 3:\n\nH3_1 + V1_2 = 2 - V2_2 - H2_1\n\nEquation 4:\n\nH3_2 + V3_2 = 2 - V2_2 - H2_2\n\nSo, if we fix values for V2_1, H2_1, V2_2, H2_2, then we can compute H1_1 + V1_1, H1_2 + V3_1, H3_1 + V1_2, H3_2 + V3_2.\n\nBut since these sums must equal 2 - V2_1 - H2_1, etc., and H1_1, V1_1, etc., are variables, we can have possible assignments based on the values of V2_1, H2_1, V2_2, H2_2.\n\nLet me consider variables V2_1, H2_1, V2_2, H2_2. Each can be 0 or 1, so there are 2^4 = 16 possible combinations.\n\nFor each combination, we can check if the resulting equations for H1_1 + V1_1, etc., are possible, and then count the number of solutions.\n\nThis seems manageable. Let's proceed.\n\nLet's denote the variables:\n\nLet’s define:\n\nA = V2_1\n\nB = H2_1\n\nC = V2_2\n\nD = H2_2\n\nEach of A, B, C, D can be 0 or 1.\n\nThen:\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\nH1_1 + V1_1 = 2 - A - B\n\nPossible values:\n\nIf 2 - A - B is 2: then H1_1 = 1, V1_1 = 1\n\nIf 2 - A - B is 1: then H1_1 and V1_1 must sum to 1, so either (1,0) or (0,1)\n\nIf 2 - A - B is 0: then H1_1 = 0, V1_1 = 0\n\nSimilarly, equation 2:\n\nH1_2 + V3_1 = 2 - A - D\n\nEquation 3:\n\nH3_1 + V1_2 = 2 - C - B\n\nEquation 4:\n\nH3_2 + V3_2 = 2 - C - D\n\nFor each combination of A, B, C, D, we can compute the right-hand sides (RHS) of these equations and determine the number of solutions for the remaining variables.\n\nAdditionally, the remaining variables are H1_1, V1_1, H1_2, V3_1, H3_1, V1_2, H3_2, V3_2. Each of these variables is involved in only one equation, except for V1_1 and V1_2 which are part of different equations but separate.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nH1_1 and V1_1 are in equation 1.\n\nH1_2 and V3_1 are in equation 2.\n\nH3_1 and V1_2 are in equation 3.\n\nH3_2 and V3_2 are in equation 4.\n\nSo, these variables are grouped into pairs, each pair appearing in one equation. Therefore, for each equation, depending on the RHS, the pair can have:\n\n- If RHS = 2: both variables must be 1.\n\n- If RHS = 1: one variable is 1, the other is 0 (two possibilities).\n\n- If RHS = 0: both variables must be 0.\n\nTherefore, for each equation, the number of solutions is:\n\n- 1 if RHS is 0 or 2,\n\n- 2 if RHS is 1.\n\nTherefore, for each combination of A, B, C, D, the total number of solutions is the product of the number of solutions for each equation (1, 2, 3, 4).\n\nTherefore, our strategy is:\n\n1. Enumerate all 16 possible combinations of A, B, C, D (each 0 or 1).\n\n2. For each combination, compute RHS for equations 1 to 4.\n\n3. For each equation, check if RHS is 0, 1, or 2. If RHS is not possible (e.g., negative or greater than 2), discard the combination.\n\n4. For valid combinations, compute the number of solutions as product of 1 or 2 for each equation.\n\n5.

The other edges are on the boundary and only belong to one square.\n\nSuppose we first color the four middle edges (H2_1, H2_2, V2_1, V2_2). There are 2^4=16 possibilities. Then, for each boundary edge, its color is determined by the requirement that each square has exactly two red edges.\n\nWait, but is that the case? Let's see.\n\nEach boundary edge belongs to only one square. Therefore, once we fix the middle edges, the boundary edges can be determined based on the remaining needed red edges for each square.\n\nFor example, take Square (1,1). It has middle edges H2_1 and V2_1. The other two edges are H1_1 and V1_1, which are boundary edges. If Square (1,1) needs two red edges, then the number of red edges among H2_1 and V2_1 plus the number of red edges among H1_1 and V1_1 must equal 2.\n\nBut since H1_1 and V1_1 are boundary edges, their colors are not shared with any other square. Therefore, once we fix H2_1 and V2_1, we can choose H1_1 and V1_1 such that their sum (red count) is 2 - (H2_1 + V2_1).\n\nSimilarly for other squares.\n\nTherefore, for each middle edge coloring (16 possibilities), the boundary edges can be colored in a way that satisfies each square's requirement.

One way.\n\nSimilarly for other squares.\n\nTherefore, for each square, given the number of red middle edges, the number of ways to color its boundary edges is 1, 2, or 1, respectively.\n\nTherefore, for each square, the number of boundary edge colorings is:\n\n- 1 if the middle edges contribute 0 or 2 red edges,\n\n- 2 if the middle edges contribute 1 red edge.\n\nSince there are four squares, the total number of colorings for the boundary edges is the product of these numbers for each square.\n\nTherefore, the total number of colorings is the sum over all 16 middle edge colorings of the product of 1 or 2 for each square depending on whether the middle edges contribute 0, 1, or 2 red edges to that square.\n\nThis aligns with our previous approach.\n\nIndeed, in our previous calculation, for each combination of A,B,C,D (middle edges), we computed the product of 1 or 2 for each equation (square), which corresponds to the number of ways to color the boundary edges for that square.\n\nTherefore, the total number of colorings is indeed the sum over all 16 middle edge colorings of 2^{k}, where k is the number of squares where the middle edges contribute 1 red edge (thus requiring a choice of 1 red boundary edge).\n\nThis confirms that our previous total of 86 is correct.\n\nBut wait, let's check this alternative approach calculation.\n\nFor each middle edge coloring (16 possibilities), compute for each square how many red middle edges it has, then compute the number of boundary colorings as product over squares of 1 or 2.\n\nFor example:\n\nTake the middle edges V2_1, H2_1, V2_2, H2_2.\n\nFor Square (1,1): middle edges H2_1 and V2_1.\n\nFor Square (1,2): middle edges H2_2 and V2_1.\n\nFor Square (2,1): middle edges H2_1 and V2_2.\n\nFor Square (2,2): middle edges H2_2 and V2_2.\n\nTherefore, for each square, the number of red middle edges is:\n\nS1 = H2_1 + V2_1\n\nS2 = H2_2 + V2_1\n\nS3 = H2_1 + V2_2\n\nS4 = H2_2 + V2_2\n\nFor each square, if S_i is 0 or 2, contributes a factor of 1; if S_i is 1, contributes a factor of 2.\n\nTherefore, total colorings for boundary edges is 2^{k}, where k is the number of squares with S_i=1.\n\nTherefore, total colorings is sum over all 16 middle edge colorings of 2^{k}, where k is the number of squares where S_i=1.\n\nThis is exactly what we computed earlier, leading to 86.\n\nBut let's verify with an example.\n\nTake middle edges all blue: V2_1=0, H2_1=0, V2_2=0, H2_2=0.\n\nThen:\n\nS1 = 0+0=0 ⇒ factor 1\n\nS2 =0+0=0 ⇒ factor 1\n\nS3=0+0=0 ⇒ factor 1\n\nS4=0+0=0 ⇒ factor 1\n\nTotal:1*1*1*1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: V2_1=0, H2_1=1, V2_2=0, H2_2=1.\n\nThen:\n\nS1=1+0=1 ⇒ factor 2\n\nS2=1+0=1 ⇒ factor 2\n\nS3=1+0=1 ⇒ factor 2\n\nS4=1+0=1 ⇒ factor 2\n\nTotal:2^4=16. Which matches case 6 and 11.\n\nAnother example: V2_1=1, H2_1=1, V2_2=1, H2_2=1.\n\nThen:\n\nS1=1+1=2 ⇒ factor 1\n\nS2=1+1=2 ⇒ factor 1\n\nS3=1+1=2 ⇒ factor 1\n\nS4=1+1=2 ⇒ factor 1\n\nTotal:1*1*1*1=1. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems consistent.\n\nThus, the total number of colorings is 86.",
