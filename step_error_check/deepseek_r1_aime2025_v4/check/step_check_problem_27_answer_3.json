Hmm, non-convex and simple, so it doesn't intersect itself. The problem gives some conditions about the areas of triangles formed with vertex A1 and consecutive vertices, the cosine of their angles, and the total perimeter.

      "reasoning_step": "First, let's parse the given information:\n\n1. For each i from 2 to 10, the area of triangle A_iA1A_{i+1} is 1.\n2. The cosine of each angle at A1 (i.e., angle A_iA1A_{i+1}) is 12/13.\n3. The perimeter of the polygon is 20.\n4. We need to find A1A2 + A1A11 in the form (m√n - p)/q with the given conditions on m, n, p, q.\n\nSo, starting with the triangles. Each triangle A_iA1A_{i+1} has area 1 and angle at A1 with cosine 12/13. Since all these angles have the same cosine, they must all be equal? Wait, cosine is 12/13, so the angle is acute. But since the polygon is non-convex, some angles might be reflex, but at vertex A1, all the angles formed by consecutive edges A1A_i and A1A_{i+1} are the same. Wait, but angle A_iA1A_{i+1} is between sides A1A_i and A1A_{i+1}. Since there are 10 such angles (from i=2 to i=10), but the polygon has 11 sides. Wait, perhaps A1 is connected to all other vertices? Wait, no, a polygon is a closed chain of edges. Wait, an 11-sided polygon has vertices A1 through A11 connected in order. So A1 is connected to A2 and A11. Then, triangles A_iA1A_{i+1} would be formed for i from 2 to 10, meaning that A1 is connected to A2, A3, ..., A11? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, in a polygon, each vertex is connected to the next. So A1 is connected to A2 and A11. Then, how are the triangles A_iA1A_{i+1} formed? For example, when i=2, triangle A2A1A3; when i=3, triangle A3A1A4; ..., up to i=10, triangle A10A1A11. So these triangles are formed by connecting A1 to each vertex A2 through A11, but the polygon itself is only the perimeter A1A2A3...A11A1. So the triangles are sub-triangles inside the polygon? But since the polygon is non-convex, some of these triangles might overlap or be outside the main polygon.\n\nBut regardless, each triangle A_iA1A_{i+1} has area 1 and angle at A1 with cosine 12/13. Let's think about the formula for the area of a triangle. The area can be given by (1/2)*ab*sinθ, where a and b are the lengths of the sides adjacent to the angle θ. Here, θ is angle A_iA1A_{i+1}, so sides A1A_i and A1A_{i+1} with angle θ between them. So for each triangle, (1/2)*A1A_i*A1A_{i+1}*sinθ = 1. And cosθ = 12/13, so sinθ = sqrt(1 - (12/13)^2) = sqrt(1 - 144/169) = sqrt(25/169) = 5/13. Therefore, sinθ = 5/13.\n\nTherefore, for each triangle, (1/2)*A1A_i*A1A_{i+1}*(5/13) = 1. Simplifying that equation:\n\n(5/26)*A1A_i*A1A_{i+1} = 1 => A1A_i*A1A_{i+1} = 26/5.\n\nSo for each i from 2 to 10, the product of A1A_i and A1A_{i+1} is 26/5. That seems like a recursive relationship. Let's denote the lengths A1A_i as x_i for i from 2 to 11. Then, for each i from 2 to 10, x_i * x_{i+1} = 26/5.\n\nBut note that x_2 = A1A2, x_3 = A1A3, ..., x_11 = A1A11. So we have a sequence of lengths x_2, x_3, ..., x_11 where each consecutive pair multiplies to 26/5. That suggests that the sequence is a geometric sequence? Because if x_{i+1} = (26/5)/x_i, then each term is determined by the previous one. So starting from x_2, x_3 = (26/5)/x_2, x_4 = (26/5)/x_3 = x_2/(26/5) * (26/5) )? Wait, maybe not exactly. Let's see:\n\nx_2 * x_3 = 26/5\n\nx_3 * x_4 = 26/5\n\nSo substituting x_3 = (26/5)/x_2 into the second equation:\n\n(26/5)/x_2 * x_4 = 26/5 => x_4 = x_2\n\nSimilarly, x_4 * x_5 = 26/5 => x_5 = (26/5)/x_4 = (26/5)/x_2\n\nSo x_5 = x_3, which is (26/5)/x_2. Then x_6 = x_2, x_7 = x_3, etc. So the sequence alternates between x_2 and x_3. Therefore, the lengths alternate between x_2 and (26/5)/x_2.\n\nSince there are 10 terms from x_2 to x_11 (since i from 2 to 11 is 10 terms), starting with x_2, then x_3 = 26/(5x_2), x_4 = x_2, x_5 = 26/(5x_2), etc. So the pattern would be x_2, 26/(5x_2), x_2, 26/(5x_2), ..., alternating.\n\nSince there are 10 terms (i=2 to i=11), let's check how many times each term appears. Starting with x_2 (i=2), then i=3: 26/(5x_2), i=4: x_2, i=5: 26/(5x_2), ..., up to i=11. Since 10 terms, starting at i=2, ending at i=11. So the number of terms: 10 terms. Since alternating, starting with x_2, then the sequence would be x_2, 26/(5x_2), x_2, 26/(5x_2), ..., repeating. Since 10 terms, even number, so 5 pairs. Therefore, x_2 appears 5 times, and 26/(5x_2) appears 5 times.\n\nWait, but i=2: x_2\n\ni=3: 26/(5x_2)\n\ni=4: x_2\n\ni=5: 26/(5x_2)\n\ni=6: x_2\n\ni=7: 26/(5x_2)\n\ni=8: x_2\n\ni=9: 26/(5x_2)\n\ni=10: x_2\n\ni=11: 26/(5x_2)\n\nWait, no. Wait, 10 terms: i=2 to i=11. Let's count:\n\ni=2: x_2\n\ni=3: x_3 = 26/(5x_2)\n\ni=4: x_4 = 26/(5x_3) = 26/(5*(26/(5x_2))) ) = x_2\n\ni=5: x_5 = 26/(5x_4) = 26/(5x_2)\n\ni=6: x_6 = x_2\n\ni=7: x_7 = 26/(5x_2)\n\ni=8: x_8 = x_2\n\ni=9: x_9 = 26/(5x_2)\n\ni=10: x_10 = x_2\n\ni=11: x_11 = 26/(5x_2)",

      "reasoning_step": "But how? The perimeter of the polygon is 20. The perimeter is the sum of all the side lengths: A1A2 + A2A3 + A3A4 + ... + A10A11 + A11A1. Wait, but in a polygon, the perimeter is the sum of all edges: A1A2, A2A3, ..., A11A1. So perimeter = sum_{i=1 to 11} A_iA_{i+1}, with A12 = A1.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the perimeter is 20. So we need to find the sum of all side lengths: A1A2 + A2A3 + ... + A11A1 = 20.\n\nBut how do these side lengths relate to the lengths A1A_i? Each side of the polygon is between consecutive vertices, so A2A3 is a side, A3A4 is another, etc. But A1 is connected to A2 and A11. So perhaps we can express each side length A_iA_{i+1} in terms of the lengths from A1?\n\nWait, but the polygon is simple but non-convex, so the sides might not all lie in a plane without crossing, but since it's simple, they don't cross. But regardless, perhaps we can use the Law of Cosines on each triangle A_iA1A_{i+1} to express the side A_iA_{i+1} in terms of A1A_i and A1A_{i+1}.\n\nYes, that seems promising. For each triangle A_iA1A_{i+1}, the sides are A1A_i, A1A_{i+1}, and A_iA_{i+1}. The angle at A1 is θ with cosθ = 12/13. So by the Law of Cosines:\n\nA_iA_{i+1}^2 = A1A_i^2 + A1A_{i+1}^2 - 2*A1A_i*A1A_{i+1}*cosθ\n\nWe know cosθ = 12/13, and from earlier, A1A_i * A1A_{i+1} = 26/5.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nA_iA_{i+1}^2 = x_i^2 + x_{i+1}^2 - 2*(26/5)*(12/13)\n\nSimplify the last term: 2*(26/5)*(12/13) = (2*26*12)/(5*13) = (2*2*12)/5 = 48/5.\n\nTherefore, A_iA_{i+1}^2 = x_i^2 + x_{i+1}^2 - 48/5.\n\nTherefore, each side length A_iA_{i+1} can be expressed as sqrt(x_i^2 + x_{i+1}^2 - 48/5).\n\nBut since we have alternating x_i's: x_2, 26/(5x_2), x_2, 26/(5x_2), etc., let's substitute these into the formula.",

Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the product x_i * x_{i+1} =26/5 for each i from 2 to10, and the sequence alternates between x_2 and 26/(5x_2). Therefore, the lengths from A1 to the vertices are x_2, 26/(5x_2), x_2, 26/(5x_2), etc. Therefore, perhaps the polygon is star-shaped with respect to A1, but since it's non-convex, some edges might fold inward.\n\nBut maybe we can model the polygon as a sequence of triangles with two alternating side lengths from A1. Since each triangle has sides x and 26/(5x), and angle between them with cosine 12/13. Then, each triangle contributes a side of sqrt(x^2 + (26/(5x))^2 - 48/5). As computed earlier.\n\nBut since there are 9 such sides (from A2A3 to A10A11), each equal to that length. Then, perimeter is x + 26/(5x) +9*sqrt(x^2 + (26/(5x))^2 -48/5) =20.\n\nLet me denote y = x +26/(5x). Then, note that sqrt(x^2 + (26/(5x))^2 -48/5) = sqrt(y^2 -20), as shown earlier.\n\nTherefore, perimeter equation becomes:\n\ny +9/(5x)*sqrt(y^2 -20) =20.\n\nBut y =x +26/(5x). Let's express 9/(5x) in terms of y:\n\nFrom y =x +26/(5x), multiply both sides by 5x:\n\n5x*y =5x^2 +26.\n\nThus, 5x^2 =5x*y -26.\n\nTherefore, x^2 =x*y -26/5.",

Not an integer. This suggests that our assumption of c=16, f=169 may be incorrect.\n\nTry another factor pair for cf=2704. Let's try c=52, f=52. Then cf=52*52=2704.\n\nFourth equation:52b +52e=260 => b +e=5.\n\nThird equation:25*52 +b*e +4*52= -1485.\n\n25*52=1300; 4*52=208. So 1300 +be +208= -1485 => be= -1485 -1300 -208= -2993. But b +e=5 and be= -2993. Not possible since discriminant would be 25 +4*2993=25+11972=11997, sqrt(11997)≈109.53, not integer.\n\nNext, try c=169, f=16.\n\nFourth equation:16b +169e=260.\n\nThird equation:25*16 +b*e +4*169= -1485.\n\n25*16=400; 4*169=676.

Not integer. Not helpful.\n\nAlternative factor pair: c= 8, f=338 (since 8*338=2704). But 338=2*169, so factors might not be integers. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different a and d. Let's try a=10, d=10.\n\nThen ad=10*10=100.\n\nSecond equation:10e +10b=50 => e +b=5.\n\nThird equation:10f +be +10c= -1485.\n\nFourth equation:bf +ce=260.\n\nFifth equation:cf=2704.\n\nAssume c and f such that cf=2704.
