The medial triangle is similar to the original triangle but scaled by 1/2, but the angles remain the same. Wait, similarity preserves angles. So, angles of DEF should be equal to angles of ABC. Wait, but ABC has angles 84°, 60°, 36°, so DEF should also have these angles? Wait, no. Wait, the medial triangle is similar to the original triangle only if the original triangle is equilateral? Wait, no. Wait, actually, the medial triangle is similar to the original triangle with a ratio of 1/2, but rotated by 180 degrees. Wait, but similarity would preserve angles regardless. So angles of DEF should be equal to angles of ABC. Therefore, angle at D is equal to angle at A, angle at E equal to angle at B, angle at F equal to angle at C? Wait, no. Wait, actually, no. The medial triangle DEF has vertices at midpoints, so the sides of DEF are parallel to the sides of ABC. Wait, no, actually, the sides of DEF are parallel to the sides of the original triangle? Wait, no, that's the case for the medial triangle in general? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nIf DEF is the medial triangle, then DE is parallel to AB, EF is parallel to BC, and FD is parallel to AC. Because DE connects midpoints of BC and AC, so DE is parallel to AB and half its length. Similarly for the others. Therefore, angles of DEF should correspond to the angles of ABC. For example, angle at D in DEF is equal to angle at A in ABC because DE is parallel to AB and DF is parallel to AC. So, angle at D is between DE and DF, which are parallel to AB and AC, so the angle should be equal to angle BAC, which is 84°. Similarly, angle at E is equal to angle ABC (60°), and angle at F is equal to angle ACB (36°). Therefore, triangle DEF has angles 84°, 60°, 36°, same as ABC. Therefore, the arcs DE, EF, FD in the circumcircle of DEF correspond to angles at F, D, E respectively. Therefore, arc DE is 2*angle DFE = 2*36° = 72°, arc EF is 2*angle DEF = 2*84° = 168°, arc FD is 2*angle EDF = 2*60° = 120°. Wait, but 72 + 168 + 120 = 360°, which checks out.",

Given angles at A, B, C: angle BAC=84°, angle ABC=60°, angle ACB=36°. Let me compute the side lengths using the Law of Sines.\n\nIn triangle ABC, sides opposite angles:\n\n- a = BC, opposite angle A (84°)\n- b = AC, opposite angle B (60°)\n- c = AB, opposite angle C (36°)\n\nLaw of Sines: a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C.\n\nSo, let’s denote the circumradius of ABC as R.

Then:\n\nFrom Law of Sines,\n\na / sin A = b / sin B => 1 / sin 84° = b / sin 60° => b = sin 60° / sin 84°\n\nSimilarly,\n\nc = sin 36° / sin 84°\n\nCompute approximate values:\n\nsin 84° ≈ 0.9945\n\nsin 60° ≈ √3/2 ≈ 0.8660\n\nsin 36° ≈ 0.5878\n\nThus,\n\nb ≈ 0.8660 / 0.9945 ≈ 0.8707\n\nc ≈ 0.5878 / 0.9945 ≈ 0.5910\n\nSo, sides:\n\nBC = a = 1\n\nAC = b ≈ 0.8707\n\nAB = c ≈ 0.5910\n\nNow, let's assign coordinates:\n\nLet’s place point B at (0,0), point C at (1,0).

Since we set BC = a =1, and using Law of Sines:\n\nFrom earlier, c = sin 36° / sin 84° ≈ 0.5878 / 0.9945 ≈ 0.5910\n\nTherefore, coordinates of A:\n\nx_A = c cos 60° ≈ 0.5910 * 0.5 ≈ 0.2955\n\ny_A = c sin 60° ≈ 0.5910 * (√3)/2 ≈ 0.5910 * 0.8660 ≈ 0.5125\n\nTherefore, midpoints:\n\nE: ((0.2955 + 1)/2, 0.5125 / 2) ≈ (1.2955/2, 0.25625) ≈ (0.64775, 0.25625)\n\nF: (0.2955 / 2, 0.5125 / 2) ≈ (0.14775, 0.25625)\n\nSo, points D (0.5,0), E (0.64775,0.25625), F (0.14775,0.25625)\n\nNow, need to find the circumcircle of DEF. Let's compute its center and radius.\n\nThe circumcircle can be found by finding the perpendicular bisectors of two sides and finding their intersection.\n\nFirst, compute the perpendicular bisector of DE.\n\nMidpoint of DE: average of coordinates of D and E.\n\nMidpoint M1: ((0.5 + 0.64775)/2, (0 + 0.25625)/2) ≈ (1.14775/2, 0.25625/2) ≈ (0.573875, 0.128125)\n\nSlope of DE: (0.25625 - 0)/(0.64775 - 0.5) ≈ 0.25625 / 0.14775 ≈ 1.733. So slope is approximately 1.733. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector slope is -1/1.733 ≈ -0.577. So approximately -√3/3, which is -0.57735.\n\nTherefore, equation of perpendicular bisector of DE: passing through M1 (0.573875, 0.128125) with slope -0.57735.\n\nSimilarly, compute perpendicular bisector of DF.\n\nMidpoint of DF: average of D and F.\n\nMidpoint M2: ((0.5 + 0.14775)/2, (0 + 0.25625)/2) ≈ (0.64775/2, 0.25625/2) ≈ (0.323875, 0.128125)\n\nSlope of DF: (0.25625 - 0)/(0.14775 - 0.5) ≈ 0.25625 / (-0.35225) ≈ -0.727. Therefore, perpendicular bisector slope is reciprocal and opposite: 1/0.727 ≈ 1.375.\n\nWait, slope of DF is (y_F - y_D)/(x_F - x_D) = (0.25625 - 0)/(0.14775 - 0.5) = 0.25625 / (-0.35225) ≈ -0.727.

So y ≈ -0.57735x + 0.3313 + 0.128125 ≈ -0.57735x + 0.4594\n\nSecond equation: y = 1.375x - 1.375*0.323875 + 0.128125 ≈ 1.375x - 0.4458 + 0.128125 ≈ 1.375x - 0.3177\n\nSet equal:\n\n-0.57735x + 0.4594 = 1.375x - 0.3177\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-0.57735x - 1.375x + 0.4594 + 0.3177 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-1.95235x) + 0.7771 = 0\n\nThus, x ≈ 0.7771 / 1.95235 ≈ 0.398\n\nThen y ≈ 1.375*0.398 - 0.3177 ≈ 0.547 - 0.3177 ≈ 0.2293\n\nSo, circumcircle center is approximately (0.398, 0.2293)\n\nRadius is the distance from center to D (0.5,0):\n\nsqrt((0.5 - 0.398)^2 + (0 - 0.2293)^2) ≈ sqrt((0.102)^2 + (-0.2293)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.0104 + 0.0526) ≈ sqrt(0.063) ≈ 0.251",

This is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (0.5,0). But wait, BD is from B to D, which is midpoint of BC. Since BC is from (0,0) to (1,0), midpoint D is (0.5,0). So BD is the line from (0,0) to (0.5,0), which is just the x-axis from 0 to 0.5. But DEF's circumcircle is centered at (0.398,0.2293) with radius ~0.251. The point D is (0.5,0) on the circle. The other intersection point G is another point on BD (the x-axis) intersecting the circle.\n\nSo, parametrize BD as x from 0 to 0.5, y=0. The circle equation is (x - 0.398)^2 + (y - 0.2293)^2 ≈ 0.251^2 ≈ 0.063.

      "reasoning_step": "In triangle ABC with coordinates B(0,0), C(1,0), A(x,y), BD is the length from B to D, midpoint of BC. Since D is (0.5,0), BD is 0.5 units. But in our earlier coordinate system with BC=1, BD=0.5. But earlier computations showed BD≈0.6965, which contradicts. Wait, this suggests inconsistency.\n\nWait, if BC is length 1, then midpoint D is at distance 0.5 from B. But earlier, when I computed BD using Apollonius's theorem assuming BC=1, AB≈0.5910, AC≈0.8707, BD²=(2AB² + 2BC² - AC²)/4≈(2*0.5910² +2*1² -0.8707²)/4≈(0.6986 +2 -0.7581)/4≈(1.9405)/4≈0.4851, BD≈0.6965. But if BC is length 1, then BD should be 0.5. Contradiction.\n\nAh, here's the mistake! Earlier, when I assigned coordinates with BC=1, but computed BD using Apollonius's theorem, I forgot that in Apollonius's theorem, BD is the median from B to AC, not to BC. Wait, no. Apollonius's theorem for the median from B to AC (midpoint E) would involve BE. But D is the midpoint of BC, so BD is not a median but a segment from B to midpoint of BC, which is just half of BC. Therefore, BD should be 0.5 if BC=1.\n\nBut earlier calculation using Law of Cosines and coordinates gave BD≈0.6965, which is incorrect. Therefore, my coordinate assignment was wrong.\n\nThis suggests a critical error in my initial coordinate setup. Let me reassess.\n\nIf BC is length 1, then midpoint D is at distance 0.5 from B. Therefore, BD=0.5. However, in triangle ABC with angles 84°, 60°, 36°, sides are determined by Law of Sines:\n\nBC = a = 2R sin 84°\n\nAB = c = 2R sin 36°\n\nAC = b = 2R sin 60°\n\nIf we set BC=1, then 2R sin84°=1 => R=1/(2 sin84°). Therefore, AB=2R sin36°= sin36°/sin84°≈0.5878/0.9945≈0.5910, and AC=2R sin60°= sin60°/sin84°≈0.8660/0.9945≈0.8707.\n\nBut Apollonius's theorem for median BE (from B to midpoint E of AC):\n\nAB² + BC² = 2BE² + 2(AE²)\n\nAE=AC/2≈0.4353\n\nThus, AB² + BC²≈0.5910² +1≈0.3493 +1≈1.3493\n\n2BE² + 2(AE²)≈2BE² +2*(0.4353)²≈2BE² +0.378≈1.3493\n\nThus, 2BE²≈1.3493 -0.378≈0.9713 => BE²≈0.4856 => BE≈0.6969, which is approximately the BD computed earlier. Wait, but BE is the median from B to AC, not BD.\n\nWait, BD is the distance from B to D, midpoint of BC, which is 0.5. But in my coordinate system earlier, I placed B at (0,0), C at (1,0), and computed coordinates of A based on angles, leading to BD≈0.6965, which contradicts BD=0.5.\n\nThis inconsistency arises because placing B at (0,0), C at (1,0), and angle at B=60°, the coordinates of A are not compatible with BC=1 and BD=0.5. Therefore, my coordinate assignment was flawed.\n\nThis suggests that assigning coordinates while maintaining BC=1 and angles given requires a different approach.\n\nLet me correct this.\n\nLet me place point B at (0,0), point C at (1,0), so BC=1. We need to find coordinates of A such that angle at A is 84°, angle at B is 60°, angle at C is 36°.\n\nUsing Law of Sines:\n\nAB / sin36° = BC / sin84° => AB = BC * sin36° / sin84° ≈1 *0.5878/0.9945≈0.5910\n\nAC / sin60° = BC / sin84° => AC= BC * sin60° / sin84°≈1 *0.8660/0.9945≈0.8707\n\nNow, coordinates of A can be found using Law of Cosines or by using trilinear coordinates.\n\nLet me compute coordinates of A.\n\nIn triangle ABC, with B at (0,0), C at (1,0), and A at (x,y). We have AB=0.5910, AC=0.8707.\n\nThus:\n\nFrom B to A: sqrt(x² + y²)=0.5910\n\nFrom C to A: sqrt((x-1)² + y²)=0.8707\n\nSquare both equations:\n\nx² + y² ≈0.3493\n\n(x-1)² + y² ≈0.7581\n\nSubtract first equation from second:\n\n(x-1)² + y² -x² -y² ≈0.7581 -0.3493\n\nExpand (x-1)² -x²= x² -2x +1 -x²= -2x +1\n\nThus, -2x +1≈0.4088 => -2x≈-0.5912 => x≈0.2956\n\nThen from x² + y²≈0.3493:\n\nx≈0.2956, x²≈0.0874\n\nThus, y²≈0.3493 -0.0874≈0.2619 => y≈0.5118\n\nTherefore, coordinates of A are approximately (0.2956,0.5118)\n\nMidpoints:\n\nD is midpoint of BC: (0.5,0)\n\nE is midpoint of AC: ((0.2956 +1)/2, (0.5118 +0)/2)≈(0.6478,0.2559)\n\nF is midpoint of AB: ((0.2956 +0)/2, (0.5118 +0)/2)≈(0.1478,0.2559)\n\nNow, compute circumcircle of DEF.\n\nPoints D(0.5,0), E(0.6478,0.2559), F(0.1478,0.2559)\n\nFind circumcircle:\n\nUsing perpendicular bisectors.\n\nMidpoint of DE: ((0.5 +0.6478)/2, (0 +0.2559)/2)≈(0.5739,0.12795)\n\nSlope of DE: (0.2559 -0)/(0.6478 -0.5)=0.2559/0.1478≈1.731\n\nPerpendicular slope: -1/1.731≈-0.577\n\nEquation: y -0.12795 = -0.577(x -0.5739)\n\nMidpoint of DF: ((0.5 +0.1478)/2, (0 +0.2559)/2)≈(0.3239,0.12795)\n\nSlope of DF: (0.2559 -0)/(0.1478 -0.5)=0.2559/(-0.3522)≈-0.726\n\nPerpendicular slope: 1/0.726≈1.377\n\nEquation: y -0.12795 =1.377(x -0.3239)\n\nSolve the two equations:\n\nFirst equation: y = -0.577x +0.577*0.5739 +0.12795≈-0.577x +0.3313 +0.12795≈-0.577x +0.4593\n\nSecond equation: y =1.377x -1.377*0.3239 +0.12795≈1.377x -0.4467 +0.12795≈1.377x -0.3188\n\nSet equal:\n\n-0.577x +0.4593 =1.377x -0.3188\n\nMove terms:\n\n-0.577x -1.377x = -0.3188 -0.4593\n\n-1.954x = -0.7781\n\nx≈0.7781/1.954≈0.398\n\ny≈-0.577*0.398 +0.4593≈-0.229 +0.4593≈0.2303\n\nThus, circumcircle center≈(0.398,0.2303), radius≈distance from center to D:\n\nsqrt((0.5 -0.398)^2 + (0 -0.2303)^2)=sqrt(0.0104 +0.0530)=sqrt(0.0634)=≈0.2517\n\nNow, find points G, H, J:\n\nG is intersection of BD (from B(0,0) to D(0.5,0)) with circumcircle other than D.\n\nParametrize BD as x=t, y=0, t from 0 to0.5.\n\nSubstitute into circle equation:\n\n(x -0.398)^2 + (y -0.2303)^2≈0.0634\n\nAt y=0:\n\n(t -0.398)^2 +0.0530≈0.0634\n\n(t -0.398)^2≈0.0104\n\nt -0.398≈±0.102\n\nThus, t≈0.398±0.102\n\nSince BD is from t=0 to t=0.5, solutions are t≈0.398+0.102=0.5 (point D) and t≈0.398-0.102=0.296\n\nThus, G≈(0.296,0)\n\nSimilarly, find H on AE.\n\nParametrize AE from A(0.2956,0.5118) to E(0.6478,0.2559):\n\nx=0.2956 + t*(0.6478 -0.2956)=0.2956 +0.3522t\n\ny=0.5118 + t*(0.2559 -0.5118)=0.5118 -0.2559t\n\nSubstitute into circle equation:\n\n(x -0.398)^2 + (y -0.2303)^2≈0.0634\n\nCompute:\n\n(0.2956 +0.3522t -0.398)^2 + (0.5118 -0.2559t -0.2303)^2≈0.0634\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-0.1024 +0.3522t)^2 + (0.2815 -0.2559t)^2≈0.0634\n\nExpand:\n\nFirst term: (0.3522t -0.1024)^2≈0.3522²t² -2*0.3522*0.1024t +0.1024²≈0.124t² -0.0722t +0.0105\n\nSecond term: ( -0.2559t +0.2815 )^2≈0.2559²t² -2*0.2559*0.2815t +0.2815²≈0.0655t² -0.1443t +0.0792\n\nSum: 0.124t² -0.0722t +0.0105 +0.0655t² -0.1443t +0.0792≈0.1895t² -0.2165t +0.0897\n\nSet equal to 0.0634:\n\n0.1895t² -0.2165t +0.0897 -0.0634≈0.1895t² -0.2165t +0.0263=0\n\nSolve:\n\nt=(0.2165±sqrt(0.2165² -4*0.1895*0.0263))/(2*0.1895)\n\nDiscriminant≈0.0469 -0.0200≈0.0269\n\nsqrt(0.0269)=0.164\n\nThus,\n\nt=(0.2165±0.164)/0.379≈\n\nt=(0.2165+0.164)/0.379≈0.3805/0.379≈1.004 (point E)\n\nt=(0.2165-0.164)/0.379≈0.0525/0.379≈0.1385\n\nThus, H≈(0.2956 +0.3522*0.1385,0.5118 -0.2559*0.1385)≈(0.2956 +0.0488,0.5118 -0.0355)≈(0.3444,0.4763)\n\nSimilarly, find J on AF.\n\nParametrize AF from A(0.2956,0.5118) to F(0.1478,0.2559):\n\nx=0.2956 + t*(0.1478 -0.2956)=0.2956 -0.1478t\n\ny=0.5118 + t*(0.2559 -0.5118)=0.5118 -0.2559t\n\nSubstitute into circle equation:\n\n(x -0.398)^2 + (y -0.2303)^2≈0.0634\n\nCompute:\n\n(0.2956 -0.1478t -0.398)^2 + (0.5118 -0.2559t -0.2303)^2≈0.0634\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-0.1024 -0.1478t)^2 + (0.2815 -0.2559t)^2≈0.0634\n\nExpand:\n\nFirst term: (-0.1478t -0.1024)^2≈0.0218t² +0.0303t +0.0105\n\nSecond term: (-0.2559t +0.2815)^2≈0.0655t² -0.1443t +0.0792\n\nSum:0.0218t² +0.0303t +0.0105 +0.0655t² -0.1443t +0.0792≈0.0873t² -0.114t +0.0897\n\nSet equal to 0.0634:\n\n0.0873t² -0.114t +0.0897 -0.0634≈0.0873t² -0.114t +0.0263=0\n\nSolve:\n\nt=(0.114±sqrt(0.114² -4*0.0873*0.0263))/(2*0.0873)\n\nDiscriminant≈0.0130 -0.0092≈0.0038\n\nsqrt(0.0038)=0.0616\n\nThus,\n\nt=(0.114±0.0616)/0.1746≈\n\nt=(0.114+0.0616)/0.1746≈0.1756/0.1746≈1.006 (point F)\n\nt=(0.114-0.0616)/0.1746≈0.0524/0.1746≈0.300\n\nThus, J≈(0.2956 -0.1478*0.300,0.5118 -0.2559*0.300)≈(0.2956 -0.0443,0.5118 -0.0768)≈(0.2513,0.4350)\n\nNow, points:\n\nG≈(0.296,0)\n\nH≈(0.3444,0.4763)\n\nJ≈(0.2513,0.4350)\n\nD=(0.5,0)\n\nE≈(0.6478,0.2559)\n\nF≈(0.1478,0.2559)\n\nCircumcircle center≈(0.398,0.2303)\n\nNow, compute central angles for arcs DE, HJ, FG.",
