Then, in each pair, the letters are placed next to each other in alphabetical order to form six two-letter words. Then these six words are listed alphabetically. We need to find the probability that the last word in this list contains the letter G. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.\n\nHmm. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: 12 letters, each paired randomly. So, the total number of possible pairings is... Well, when pairing n items, the number of ways is (n-1)!! if n is even. Here n=12, so total pairings would be 11!! = 11×9×7×5×3×1. Let me confirm: 11!! = 11×9×7×5×3×1 = 10395. Wait, but maybe I need to think differently. The total number of ways to partition 12 distinct elements into 6 unordered pairs is 12!/(2^6 * 6!). Let me check that formula. Yes, because for each pair, we divide by 2! since the order within the pair doesn't matter, and then divide by 6! since the order of the pairs doesn't matter. So total pairings are 12!/(2^6 * 6!) = 10395. So that's correct. So total possible groupings are 10395.\n\nNow, each pair is ordered alphabetically. So, for example, if a pair is G and D, it becomes DG. Then, these six two-letter words are listed alphabetically. So, the list is sorted, and we need the probability that the last word in this sorted list contains G.",

But KL is higher than KJ. Similarly, L can only be paired with someone else, but since L is the last letter, pairing L with any other letter would result in the pair being [other letter]L, since L is after all others. So, for example, if L is paired with A, the pair is AL; paired with B, BL, etc. So, the pair involving L will always have L as the second letter, so the word is [something]L. Therefore, the highest possible starting letter for a word is K (since KL would be a word starting with K), unless K is paired with L. Wait, KL would start with K, but if K is paired with someone else, say J, then KJ starts with K as well. Similarly, if K is paired with L, then KL is the highest possible word. If K is paired with someone else, then KJ, KK (but there's only one K), etc. Wait, but all letters are distinct.

Otherwise, it will be K paired with someone else (J, I, etc.), making KJ, KI, etc., whichever has the highest second letter.

But since L is the highest letter, if K is not paired with L, then L must be paired with someone else, making a word like AL, BL, ..., JL.

Therefore, the highest starting letter in the remaining pairs would be J (if J is paired with someone higher than J?), but wait, J is paired with someone. Wait, no: If K is paired with, say, A, then the remaining letters are B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, L. These need to be paired into five pairs. The highest remaining letter is L, but L paired with someone else will start with the other letter.

So, J can be paired with L, making JL, or with someone lower, making GJ, HJ, IJ, JJ (but no duplicate letters), etc. Wait, JJ isn't possible since there's only one J.

Wait, no. Wait, if K is paired with L, KL is the maximum. If K is paired with someone else, say J, then KJ is the maximum. If K is paired with someone lower, then KJ would still be higher than any other pair unless J is paired with L. Wait, no. If K is paired with J, then KJ is a word. If J is paired with L, then JL is a word. KJ comes after JL because K comes after J. So KJ is higher.\n\nTherefore, regardless of how K is paired, if K is paired with someone, that pair will be the maximum unless K is paired with L, in which case KL is the maximum. Wait, no. Wait, if K is paired with L, KL is the maximum. If K is paired with J, KJ is the maximum. If K is paired with I, KI is the maximum, etc. So, the pair containing K is always the maximum, unless K is paired with L. Wait, no. Wait, if K is paired with L, KL is the maximum. If K is paired with J, KJ is the maximum. If K is paired with A, AK is the pair, which is much lower. Wait, but AK starts with A, so AK would not be the maximum. Wait, hold on. If K is paired with A, then the pair is AK, which starts with A. Then, the maximum pair would be the pair containing L. Since L is paired with someone else, say B, then BL is the pair. BL starts with B. If L is paired with J, JL starts with J. So, in this case, JL would be higher than AK. Wait, but if K is paired with A, then KJ is not formed; instead, AK is formed, and JL is formed if J is paired with L. So JL would be higher than AK. Therefore, the maximum word in this case would be JL.\n\nWait, so if K is paired with a lower letter, then the maximum word is determined by the remaining letters. Specifically, the remaining letters after pairing K with someone else. So, if K is paired with A, then we have letters B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, L left. Pairing these into five pairs. The maximum pair among these would be JL if J is paired with L, otherwise, IL if I is paired with L, etc.\n\nTherefore, the maximum word is either KL (if K is paired with L), or the maximum pair among the remaining letters after pairing K with someone else.

However, after pairing K with someone else, and L with G, the remaining letters are paired among themselves. But if there are higher letters than G remaining, their pairs could form higher words.\n\nWait, no. Once K is paired with someone else, and L is paired with G, the remaining letters are A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J (assuming K was paired with someone else, say X, and L paired with G). Wait, no: Original letters are A-L. K is paired with someone else (not L), say W. Then L is paired with G. So remaining letters are A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, and the partner of K. Wait, this is getting too complicated.\n\nBut according to our earlier reasoning, if we pair L with G, then GL is formed. The remaining pairs must be such that none of them form a higher pair than GL. However, letters H, I, J are still present and can form pairs like HI, HJ, IJ, etc. These pairs start with H, I, J, which are higher than G. Therefore, even if L is paired with G, forming GL, if H is paired with I, forming HI, which starts with H, then HI is higher than GL. Therefore, GL would not be the maximum pair.\n\nTherefore, our previous calculation is incorrect because even if L is paired with G, there might still be higher pairs among the remaining letters.\n\nThis suggests that our initial approach is flawed because we didn't consider that pairing L with G doesn't necessarily make GL the maximum pair.\n\nThis is a critical mistake. Therefore, we need to rethink.\n\nThe correct approach must ensure that when we pair G with L, all other pairs are such that none of them form a higher pair than GL. But since there are letters higher than G (H, I, J) remaining, unless they are paired in a way that their pairs start with lower letters.\n\nBut H, I, J can be paired with each other or with lower letters. If H is paired with I, HI starts with H. If H is paired with J, HJ starts with H. If I is paired with J, IJ starts with I. All of these are higher than GL.\n\nTherefore, pairing L with G cannot result in GL being the maximum pair unless all H, I, J are paired with letters lower than G, so their pairs start with lower letters. For example, if H is paired with A, forming AH; I paired with B, BI; J paired with C, CJ. Then, the pairs AH, BI, CJ start with A, B, C, which are lower than G. In this case, GL would be the maximum pair.\n\nTherefore, the probability that GL is the maximum pair is the probability that L is paired with G AND all of H, I, J are paired with letters lower than G.\n\nBut this seems very low. Let's compute this probability.\n\nFirst, pair K with someone else (not L): probability 10/11.\n\nThen, pair L with G: probability 1/10 (since there are 10 letters left after pairing K, and L can pair with any of them).\n\nThen, pair H, I, J with letters lower than G (A-F).

But in reality, after pairing K with a lower letter and L with G, there are 4 lower letters left (from A-F, excluding K's partner and G). H, I, J need to be paired with these 4 lower letters. However, there are 3 higher letters (H, I, J) and 4 lower letters. The number of ways to pair H, I, J with lower letters is C(4,3) * 3! * (remaining 1 lower letter paired with itself? No, remaining letters would be 4 lower letters, pairing H, I, J with 3 of them, leaving 1 lower letter, which must pair with someone else. But there are no other letters left except the lower letters and H, I, J. Wait, after pairing K with a lower letter (A-F), L with G, we have remaining letters:\n\nLower letters: A-F (6) minus K's partner (1) minus G (1) = 4.\n\nHigher letters: H, I, J (3).\n\nSo total remaining letters: 4 + 3 = 7. Wait, 7 letters can't be paired into pairs. This suggests a mistake.\n\nAh, here's the mistake. Total letters:\n\nOriginal: 12.\n\nAfter pairing K with a lower letter (A-F), L with G, we have:\n\nPaired letters: K, lower; L, G.\n\nRemaining letters: 12 - 4 = 8 letters.\n\nThese 8 letters consist of:\n\nLower letters: A-F (6) minus K's partner (1) minus G (1) = 4.\n\nHigher letters: H, I, J (3), and the partner of K (who is a lower letter, already paired).\n\nWait, no: K's partner is a lower letter, which has already been paired with K. So remaining letters are A-F minus K's partner, plus H, I, J, L, G. Wait, L is paired with G, so remaining letters are A-F minus K's partner minus G, plus H, I, J.\n\nBut G is paired with L, so G is already out. L is paired with G, so L is already out. K is paired with a lower letter, so K is out. So remaining letters are:\n\nA-F minus K's partner (1) minus G (1) = 4 letters.\n\nPlus H, I, J: 3 letters.\n\nTotal remaining letters: 4 + 3 = 7 letters. Which is odd, so impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the approach.\n\nThis indicates that the previous reasoning is flawed. The correct approach must account for all pairings without leaving an odd number of letters.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct way is to recognize that for G to be in the last pair, G must be paired with L, and all letters higher than G (H, I, J, K) must be paired among themselves or with letters lower than G. This ensures that no pair starting with H, I, J, or K exists, making GL the highest pair.\n\nThe number of ways to pair H, I, J, K among themselves or with letters lower than G:\n\nLetters higher than G: H, I, J, K (4 letters).\n\nLetters lower than G: A, B, C, D, E, F (6 letters).\n\nWe need to pair the 4 higher letters with each other or with the 6 lower letters. The total number of ways to do this is the number of ways to pair 4 higher letters and 6 lower letters into pairs, ensuring that each higher letter is either paired with another higher letter or with a lower letter.\n\nHowever, GL must be paired, so L is already paired with G. Wait, no: L is paired with G in this scenario. So L is not among the higher letters anymore. The higher letters are H, I, J, K.\n\nSo, to ensure that none of H, I, J, K form a pair starting with themselves, they must be paired with someone higher or lower. But since they are the highest remaining letters, they can only be paired with each other or lower letters.\n\nIf they are paired with each other, the pair starts with the lower of the two. For example, pairing H with I gives HI, starting with H. Pairing H with K gives HK, starting with H. Pairing I with K gives IK, starting with I.\n\nTherefore, pairing higher letters among themselves still results in pairs starting with H, I, or J, which are higher than G. Therefore, to prevent any pair from starting with H, I, J, or K, these letters must be paired with lower letters (A-F).\n\nTherefore, all four letters H, I, J, K must be paired with lower letters (A-F). This ensures that their pairs start with the lower letters.\n\nThe number of ways to pair H, I, J, K with A-F:\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the number of ways to pair 4 distinct higher letters with 6 distinct lower letters, allowing each higher letter to choose a lower letter partner, with no overlaps.\n\nThis is a matching problem. The number of ways is P(6,4) = 6*5*4*3 = 360.\n\nThen, the remaining lower letters (6 - 4 = 2) can be paired among themselves in 1 way.\n\nThe remaining higher letters (4 - 4 = 0) are already paired.\n\nTherefore, the total number of favorable pairings is:\n\nPair L with G: 1 way.\n\nPair K, H, I, J with A-F: 360 ways.\n\nPair the remaining 2 lower letters: 1 way.\n\nPair the remaining letters (none left).\n\nTotal favorable pairings: 1 * 360 * 1 = 360.\n\nBut wait, the total number of pairings where L is paired with G and H, I, J, K are paired with A-F is 360. However, we also need to pair the remaining letters after pairing L-G and H, I, J, K with A-F. The remaining letters are A-F minus the 4 paired with H, I, J, K. So 6 - 4 = 2 lower letters, which are paired together. So yes, 1 way.\n\nBut the total number of pairings of the entire set where L is paired with G and H, I, J, K are paired with A-F is:\n\nNumber of ways to pair L with G: 1.\n\nNumber of ways to pair H, I, J, K with A-F: P(6,4) = 360.\n\nNumber of ways to pair the remaining 2 lower letters: 1.\n\nNumber of ways to pair the remaining letters (A-F - 4 paired with H, I, J, K - L and G): already done.\n\nBut the total number of pairings is 12!/(2^6 * 6!) = 10395.\n\nBut wait, the total number of favorable pairings is:\n\n1 (L-G) * [6*5*4*3 (pairing H, I, J, K with A-F)] * [1 (pairing remaining 2 lower letters)] * [pairing K with someone else? No, K is already paired with a lower letter.]\n\nWait, K is one of the higher letters being paired with a lower letter. So K is paired with a lower letter, H, I, J are paired with lower letters, L is paired with G, and the remaining two lower letters are paired together.\n\nTherefore, the total number of favorable pairings is:\n\n1 * 6*5*4*3 * 1 = 360.\n\nBut total pairings is 10395.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 360 / 10395.\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 15: 360 ÷ 15 = 24, 10395 ÷ 15 = 693.\n\n24/693.

Last pair AD contains A and D.\n\nSo in this case, the probability that A is in the last pair is 1/3 (only when AD is the pair).\n\nBut according to the first approach:\n\nTotal favorable pairings where A is paired with D: 1.\n\nTotal pairings: 3.\n\nProbability 1/3.\n\nAccording to sequential probability:\n\nProbability A pairs with D: 1/3.\n\nGiven that, the remaining pair is B and C. Probability that BC is the pair: 1.\n\nTotal probability: 1/3 * 1 = 1/3.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nIf we use the second approach:\n\nProbability A pairs with D: 1/3.\n\nProbability B pairs with C: 1/1.\n\nTotal probability: 1/3.\n\nCorrect.\n\nBut if we applied the second approach to the original problem:\n\nProbability L pairs with G: 1/11.\n\nProbability K pairs with lower: 6/10.\n\nProbability H pairs with lower: 5/9.\n\nProbability I pairs with lower: 4/8.\n\nProbability J pairs with lower: 3/7.\n\nMultiply: 1/11 * 6/10 * 5/9 * 4/8 * 3/7 = 1/154.\n\nBut this doesn't match the first approach. Why?\n\nBecause in the small example, once A is paired with D, the remaining pair is forced. But in the original problem, after pairing L with G and K with a lower letter, there are still H, I, J to pair with lowers, but the available lowers decrease each time.\n\nHowever, the first approach counts all possible ways to pair H, I, J, K with lowers, while the second approach multiplies the probabilities sequentially, which should give the same result. But they don't.\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the first approach.\n\nWait, the total number of favorable pairings is not 360. Because when pairing H, I, J, K with lowers, K is one of the higher letters. So pairing K with a lower letter is part of the process.\n\nBut in the first approach, we counted pairing K, H, I, J with lowers as permutations P(6,4) = 360. However, this assumes that K, H, I, J are distinguishable and the lowers are distinguishable. But in reality, the pairings are unordered.\n\nThe correct number of ways to pair H, I, J, K with A-F is:\n\nChoose 4 distinct lower letters and pair them with H, I, J, K.\n\nNumber of ways: C(6,4) * 4! = 15 * 24 = 360.\n\nYes, this matches.\n\nThen pair the remaining 2 lower letters: 1 way.\n\nSo total favorable pairings: 360.\n\nTotal pairings: 10395.\n\n360/10395 = 8/231.\n\nBut according to the sequential probability approach, it's 1/154.\n\nThis discrepancy must be resolved.\n\nWait, the sequential probability approach is incorrect because it assumes independence at each step, but the available pool changes after each pairing.\n\nFor example, after pairing K with a lower letter, the number of available lower letters decreases, affecting the subsequent probabilities.\n\nHowever, the first approach correctly counts the total number of favorable pairings by considering all possible assignments at once, which is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the correct probability is 8/231.\n\nBut wait, let's check with another method.\n\nThe probability that L is paired with G is 1/11.\n\nGiven that L is paired with G, the probability that K is paired with a lower letter is 6/10.\n\nGiven that, the probability that H is paired with a lower letter is 5/8 (since after pairing K with a lower letter, there are 5 lower letters left and 8 remaining letters: H, I, J, and 5 lowers).\n\nWait, no: After pairing L with G and K with a lower letter, we have 12 - 4 = 8 letters left.\n\nThese 8 letters consist of H, I, J and 5 lower letters (A-F minus K's partner).\n\nSo the probability that H is paired with a lower letter is 5/7 (since H can pair with 7 remaining letters: I, J, and 5 lowers).\n\nSimilarly, after pairing H with a lower letter, the probability that I is paired with a lower letter is 4/5 (4 lowers left, 5 letters: I, J, and 3 lowers).\n\nThen, the probability that J is paired with a lower letter is 3/3 = 1.\n\nMultiply these probabilities:\n\n1/11 * 6/10 * 5/7 * 4/5 * 1 =\n\n(1/11) * (6/10) * (5/7) * (4/5) * 1 =\n\n(1/11) * (6/10) * (4/7) * 1 =\n\n(1/11) * (24/70) =\n\n24/770 =\n\n12/385 ≈ 0.03116.\n\nThis is different from both previous results.\n\nClearly, there's confusion in the approaches. This suggests that the problem is more complex and requires a more careful combinatorial analysis.\n\nAnother approach: Use linearity of expectation. Let's consider the probability that G is in the last pair. For each pair that includes G, compute the probability that this pair is the last one, and sum over all possible pairs containing G.",
