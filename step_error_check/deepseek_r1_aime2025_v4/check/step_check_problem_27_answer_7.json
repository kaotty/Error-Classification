The area of each triangle A_iA1A_{i+1} is 1 for each i from 2 to 10.\n2. The cosine of each angle at A1 (i.e., angle A_iA1A_{i+1}) is 12/13.\n3. The perimeter of the entire polygon is 20.\n\nWe need to find the sum A1A2 + A1A11, express it in the form (m√n - p)/q, where m, n, p, q are positive integers, n is square-free, and no prime divides all of m, p, q. Then compute m + n + p + q.\n\nFirst, let's parse the problem. The polygon is non-convex and simple, meaning it doesn't intersect itself. The key points here are the triangles formed by A1 with consecutive vertices. Each of these triangles has area 1 and the cosine of their apex angle at A1 is 12/13. Also, the perimeter of the polygon is 20.\n\nSo, starting with A1, there are triangles A2A1A3, A3A1A4, ..., A10A1A11. Each of these triangles has area 1 and angle at A1 with cosine 12/13. Let's try to model this.\n\nEach triangle A_iA1A_{i+1} has sides A1A_i, A1A_{i+1}, and A_iA_{i+1}. The area is 1, and the angle at A1 is θ with cosθ = 12/13, so sinθ = sqrt(1 - (12/13)^2) = sqrt(1 - 144/169) = sqrt(25/169) = 5/13.\n\nThe area of a triangle can be given by (1/2)*ab*sinθ, where a and b are the sides adjacent to the angle θ. So, for each triangle A_iA1A_{i+1}, the area is (1/2)*A1A_i*A1A_{i+1}*sinθ = 1. Since sinθ is 5/13, this gives:\n\n(1/2)*A1A_i*A1A_{i+1}*(5/13) = 1\n\nMultiply both sides by 2/(5/13):\n\nA1A_i*A1A_{i+1} = (2*1)/(5/13) = 26/5",

The indices here: i runs from 2 to 10, so the triangles are A2A1A3, A3A1A4, ..., A10A1A11. Each triangle connects A1 with two vertices that are adjacent in the polygon. So, each triangle shares a side with the next triangle. For example, triangle A2A1A3 shares side A1A3 with triangle A3A1A4.\n\nBut the sides A1A2, A1A3, ..., A1A11 are all edges from A1 to other vertices. Let's denote the lengths of these edges as r2, r3, ..., r11, where r_i = A1A_i. So, r2 = A1A2, r3 = A1A3, ..., r11 = A1A11.\n\nNow, each triangle A_iA1A_{i+1} (for i from 2 to 10) has sides r_i, r_{i+1}, and A_iA_{i+1}. The area is 1, so (1/2)*r_i*r_{i+1}*sinθ = 1.

The perimeter is the sum of all the sides of the polygon: A1A2 + A2A3 + A3A4 + ... + A10A11 + A11A1. Wait, but wait, the polygon is 11-sided, so the perimeter is the sum of all edges: A1A2, A2A3, ..., A11A1. Wait, but the problem states \"The perimeter of A1A2…A11 is 20.\" So, perimeter is the sum of the edges around the polygon: A1A2 + A2A3 + ... + A10A11 + A11A1. Wait, but A11A1 is part of the perimeter? Wait, but in a polygon, the perimeter is the sum of all edges. So, in an 11-sided polygon, there are 11 edges. So, perimeter is A1A2 + A2A3 + ... + A10A11 + A11A1. So, yes, including A11A1.\n\nBut in our problem, the perimeter is 20. However, the problem mentions \"the perimeter of A1A2…A11 is 20.\" So, maybe A11A1 is included? Wait, yes, otherwise it wouldn't be a closed polygon. So, perimeter is 20, which includes all edges, including A11A1. But in our setup, we have edges from A1 to each vertex: A1A2, A1A3, ..., A1A11. Wait, but those are not the edges of the polygon. Wait, no. The polygon edges are A1A2, A2A3, A3A4, ..., A10A11, A11A1. So, perimeter is the sum of those edges.\n\nBut in our problem, we have triangles A_iA1A_{i+1} with area 1 and angle at A1. So, each triangle shares two edges from A1 (A1A_i and A1A_{i+1}) and one edge of the polygon (A_iA_{i+1}).\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the polygon is the sum of all A_iA_{i+1} for i from 1 to 11 (with A12 being A1). But according to the problem statement, the perimeter is 20. So, sum_{i=1 to 11} A_iA_{i+1} = 20, where A12 = A1.\n\nBut each edge A_iA_{i+1} (for i from 2 to 10) is part of the triangle A_iA1A_{i+1}. So, the length of A_iA_{i+1} can be found using the law of cosines. For triangle A_iA1A_{i+1}, sides A1A_i, A1A_{i+1}, and A_iA_{i+1}. The angle at A1 is θ with cosθ = 12/13. So, by the law of cosines:\n\nA_iA_{i+1}^2 = A1A_i^2 + A1A_{i+1}^2 - 2*A1A_i*A1A_{i+1}*cosθ\n\nWe know A1A_i = r_i and A1A_{i+1} = r_{i+1}, so:\n\nA_iA_{i+1}^2 = r_i^2 + r_{i+1}^2 - 2*r_i*r_{i+1}*(12/13)\n\nBut we also know from earlier that r_i*r_{i+1} = 26/5. So substituting:\n\nA_iA_{i+1}^2 = r_i^2 + r_{i+1}^2 - 2*(26/5)*(12/13)\n\nSimplify the last term:\n\n2*(26/5)*(12/13) = (2*26*12)/(5*13) = (52*12)/(65) = (624)/65 = 96/10 = 48/5\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\n26/5 * 12/13 = (26*12)/(5*13) = (2*12)/(5) = 24/5\n\nThen multiplied by 2: 48/5\n\nSo, A_iA_{i+1}^2 = r_i^2 + r_{i+1}^2 - 48/5\n\nTherefore, A_iA_{i+1} = sqrt(r_i^2 + r_{i+1}^2 - 48/5)\n\nBut since r_i and r_{i+1} are consecutive terms in the sequence, which alternates between a and 26/(5a), let's substitute.\n\nFor i from 2 to 10, each A_iA_{i+1} corresponds to r_i and r_{i+1} which are either (a and 26/(5a)) or (26/(5a) and a). Wait, actually, since the sequence alternates between a and 26/(5a), each consecutive pair is either (a, 26/(5a)) or (26/(5a), a). But multiplication is commutative, so r_i^2 + r_{i+1}^2 is the same in either case. Therefore, for each pair, the squared length is a^2 + (26/(5a))^2 - 48/5.\n\nSo, each A_iA_{i+1} (for i from 2 to 10) is sqrt(a^2 + (26/(5a))^2 - 48/5). Let's compute this expression.\n\nFirst, compute a^2 + (26/(5a))^2:\n\na^2 + (676)/(25a^2)\n\nThen subtract 48/5:\n\nSo, total expression is:\n\nsqrt(a^2 + 676/(25a^2) - 48/5)\n\nLet's combine terms:\n\nConvert a^2 to 25a^2/25 to have a common denominator:\n\n= sqrt( (25a^4 + 676 - 240a^2)/25a^2 )\n\nWait, let's see:\n\na^2 + 676/(25a^2) - 48/5\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 25a^2 to combine:\n\n= sqrt( [25a^4 + 676 - 240a^2] / (25a^2) )\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n25a^4 - 240a^2 + 676\n\nLet’s factor this quadratic in terms of a^2:\n\nLet’s denote x = a^2.

Wait, each A_iA_{i+1} for i=2 to10 is computed as sqrt(25a^4 -240a^2 +676)/(5a). Since a is fixed, all these edges would have the same length. Is that possible?\n\nWait, but in the polygon, edges A2A3, A3A4, etc., are all sides of the polygon. If they are all equal, then the polygon would have some regularity. But since the polygon is non-convex and simple, maybe not. However, according to our setup, each of these edges (from i=2 to10) is equal to sqrt(25a^4 -240a^2 +676)/(5a). So, same length. Then edges A1A2, A1A11, and the other edges A1A3, etc., are different.\n\nBut the perimeter includes all edges: A1A2, A2A3, A3A4, ..., A10A11, A11A1. So, perimeter is:\n\nA1A2 + A2A3 + A3A4 + ... + A10A11 + A11A1\n\nFrom our setup:\n\nA1A2 = r2 = a\n\nA11A1 = r11 = 26/(5a)\n\nThe edges A2A3, A3A4, ..., A10A11: there are 9 edges here (from i=2 to10), each equal to sqrt(25a^4 -240a^2 +676)/(5a)\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, i=2 to10 corresponds to edges A2A3 up to A10A11, which is 9 edges. Then we have edges A1A2 and A11A1, which are a and 26/(5a). Additionally, the edge A1A11 is part of the polygon? Wait, no. The polygon is A1A2A3...A11A1. So, the edges are A1A2, A2A3, ..., A10A11, A11A1. So, total of 11 edges. The edges between non-A1 vertices are A2A3, A3A4, ..., A10A11 (9 edges), and the edges connecting to A1 are A1A2 and A11A1. Wait, but A1 is connected to A2 and A11, but also to A3, A4, ..., A10 via the triangles. Wait, no. In the polygon, the edges are only the consecutive ones: A1 connected to A2 and A11, A2 connected to A3, etc. The other connections (A1 to A3, etc.) are diagonals, not edges of the polygon.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter is indeed A1A2 + A2A3 + ... + A10A11 + A11A1. So, total 11 edges. Among these, edges A2A3 through A10A11 are 9 edges each of length sqrt(25a^4 -240a^2 +676)/(5a), and edges A1A2 = a, A11A1 =26/(5a). So, perimeter is:\n\na + 9*sqrt(25a^4 -240a^2 +676)/(5a) +26/(5a) =20\n\nTherefore, equation:\n\na + 26/(5a) + (9/(5a))*sqrt(25a^4 -240a^2 +676) =20\n\nThis is a complex equation in terms of a.

So sqrt(25677)=3^2*sqrt(317)=9*sqrt(317). Therefore sqrt(2567700)=10*9*sqrt(317)=90*sqrt(317)\n\nThus sqrt(D)=90√317\n\nTherefore, t=(-50 ±90√317)/200= (-50 +90√317)/200 or (-50 -90√317)/200.

Primes dividing 9 are 3; primes dividing5 are5; primes dividing20 are2,5. No common prime. Therefore, m=9, n=317, p=5, q=20. Thus m +n +p +q=9 +317 +5 +20=351.",
