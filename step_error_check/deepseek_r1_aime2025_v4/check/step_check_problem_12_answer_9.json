      "reasoning_step": "\n\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. It's about finding the area of a finite region formed by points in the plane x + y + z = 75 that satisfy the inequalities x - yz < y - zx < z - xy. The answer needs to be in the form a√b, where a and b are positive integers with b square-free, and then find a + b. Hmm, this seems complex, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the setup. We're dealing with points in 3D space, but they all lie on the plane x + y + z = 75. So, effectively, we can reduce this to a 2D problem by parameterizing the plane. Maybe we can express one variable in terms of the other two. For example, z = 75 - x - y. Then, substitute z into the inequalities to get them in terms of x and y. That might simplify things.\n\nSo, substituting z = 75 - x - y into the inequalities:\n\nFirst inequality: x - yz < y - zx\n\nSecond inequality: y - zx < z - xy\n\nLet me substitute z in both inequalities.\n\nStarting with the first inequality:\n\nx - y(75 - x - y) < y - (75 - x - y)x\n\nLet me expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: x - 75y + xy + y²\n\nRight side: y - 75x + x² + xy\n\nSo, the inequality becomes:\n\nx - 75y + xy + y² < y - 75x + x² + xy\n\nSimplify both sides by subtracting xy from both sides:\n\nx - 75y + y² < y - 75x + x²\n\nBring all terms to the left side:\n\nx - 75y + y² - y + 75x - x² < 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(1 + 75)x + (-75 -1)y + y² - x² < 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n76x -76y + y² - x² < 0\n\nFactor terms:\n\nNotice that 76x -76y = 76(x - y), and y² - x² = -(x² - y²) = -(x - y)(x + y)\n\nSo, rewrite the inequality:\n\n76(x - y) - (x - y)(x + y) < 0\n\nFactor out (x - y):\n\n(x - y)(76 - (x + y)) < 0\n\nSo, the first inequality simplifies to:\n\n(x - y)(76 - (x + y)) < 0\n\nOkay, that's a nice simplification. Let's note that down.\n\nNow, moving to the second inequality: y - zx < z - xy\n\nAgain, substitute z = 75 - x - y:\n\nLeft side: y - x(75 - x - y)\n\nRight side: (75 - x - y) - x y\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: y - 75x + x² + x y\n\nRight side: 75 - x - y - x y\n\nSo, inequality becomes:\n\ny - 75x + x² + x y < 75 - x - y - x y\n\nBring all terms to the left side:\n\ny -75x + x² + x y -75 + x + y + x y < 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-75x + x) + (y + y) + x² + x y + x y -75 < 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-74x) + 2y + x² + 2x y -75 < 0",

Since z =75 -x -y, we can parametrize the plane with coordinates x and y, and express everything in terms of x and y.\n\nSo, let's consider the inequalities:\n\n1. (x - y)(76 -x - y) <0\n\n2. (x + 2y -75)(x +1) <0\n\nWe need to find the region in the x-y plane where both inequalities are satisfied, and then find the area of the finite convex region among the three disjoint regions mentioned.\n\nBut first, let's analyze each inequality separately.\n\nStarting with the first inequality: (x - y)(76 -x - y) <0\n\nLet me denote S = x + y. Then, 76 - S = 76 -x - y.\n\nSo, the first inequality is (x - y)(76 - S) <0.\n\nSimilarly, the second inequality is (x + 2y -75)(x +1) <0.\n\nLet me consider the first inequality.\n\nCase 1: (x - y) >0 and (76 - S) <0\n\nCase 2: (x - y) <0 and (76 - S) >0\n\nSo, the first inequality splits into two cases:\n\nEither x > y and S >76, or x < y and S <76.\n\nSimilarly, the second inequality: (x + 2y -75)(x +1) <0\n\nLet me denote T = x + 2y -75.\n\nSo, the inequality is T*(x +1) <0.\n\nWhich splits into:\n\nEither T >0 and x +1 <0, or T <0 and x +1 >0.\n\nSo, Case A: x + 2y -75 >0 and x < -1\n\nCase B: x + 2y -75 <0 and x > -1\n\nTherefore, the second inequality requires either (T >0 and x < -1) or (T <0 and x > -1)\n\nSo, combining both inequalities, the solution set is the intersection of the regions defined by the first and second inequalities.\n\nSo, possible combinations:\n\nFirst inequality has two cases:\n\n1. x > y and S >76\n\n2. x < y and S <76\n\nSecond inequality has two cases:\n\nA. x +2y >75 and x < -1\n\nB. x +2y <75 and x > -1\n\nSo, the intersection regions would be combinations of these cases.\n\nSo, possible regions:\n\n1 and A: x > y, S >76, x +2y >75, x < -1\n\nBut if x < -1, and S =x + y >76, then y >76 -x. Since x < -1, y >76 -x >76 -(-1) =77. So y >77. But x < -1 and y >77. Then x > y would require x > y >77, but x < -1. Contradiction. So this intersection is empty.\n\n1 and B: x > y, S >76, x +2y <75, x > -1\n\nSimilarly, x > y and x + y >76, but x +2y <75. Let's see if this is possible.\n\nLet me express x + y >76 and x +2y <75.\n\nFrom x + y >76, we have y >76 -x.\n\nSubstitute into x +2y <75:\n\nx +2y <75\n\nBut y >76 -x, so substitute y =76 -x + ε, where ε >0.\n\nThen x +2(76 -x + ε) =x +152 -2x +2ε = -x +152 +2ε <75\n\nSo, -x +152 +2ε <75 → -x <75 -152 -2ε → -x < -77 -2ε → x >77 +2ε\n\nBut x >77 +2ε and x > y. But since y >76 -x, and x >77, then y >76 -77 = -1. So y > -1. But x >77 and y > -1, but x + y >76. So x >77, y > -1, x + y >76. Possible.\n\nBut x +2y <75. Let's see, with x >77 and y > -1:\n\nx +2y <75 → Since x >77, even if y is minimal (y approaches -1), x +2y >77 +2*(-1) =75. So x +2y approaches 75 from above. But the inequality is x +2y <75. But if x >77, even with y approaching -1, x +2y =77 +2*(-1)=75, but x is greater than 77, so x +2y would be greater than 75. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, this intersection is also empty.",

So, y <x, S =x + y >76. Then x +2y = y + S. Since y <x and S >76, y + S > y +76. But x +2y <75, so y +76 <75 → y < -1. But S =x + y >76, and y < -1. Then x >76 - y. Since y < -1, 76 - y >77. So x >77. Then x >77 and y < -1. But x > y, which is true since y < -1 and x >77. So possible.\n\nWait, but x +2y <75. If x >77 and y < -1, then x +2y >77 +2*(-1)=75. So x +2y >75.

Therefore, this suggests that the correct area is1014√3, leading to1017.\n\nBut this contradicts the previous integral calculation.

Here, b=3, which is square-free. Therefore, a=1014 and b=3, so a+b=1017.\n\nBut earlier integral gave1875/4=468.75. These results conflict.\n\nThe shoelace result suggests the area is1014, but this is for the trapezoid with vertices at(-1,38), (-1,77), (38,38), (25,25).\n\nBut according to the problem, the finite region is one of three, and the shoelace area is for an unbounded region. But according to the problem, exactly one region is finite.\n\nTherefore, this suggests that the correct finite region is the one computed via the shoelace formula, leading to1014√3 and answer1017.\n\nHowever, I'm confused because earlier analysis suggested the finite region is where x < y <z, but the shoelace formula gives a different result.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the possibility that the finite region is the trapezoid calculated via shoelace, I'll conclude the answer is1017.\n",
