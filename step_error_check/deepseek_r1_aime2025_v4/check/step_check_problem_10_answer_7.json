Therefore, x must appear exactly once in each row i, spread across Blocks A, B, or C. But since each block must contain x exactly once (as each block contains all numbers), x must appear exactly once in each block, once per block. Wait, no. Each block contains x exactly once. Therefore, x appears once in Block A, once in Block B, once in Block C. Each x is in one of the three blocks, and in each block, it's in one of the three rows.\n\nBut since each row of the entire grid contains x exactly once, x must be in row 1 of one block, row 2 of another block, and row 3 of the third block. Wait, no. Wait, if x is in Block A, it's in some row of Block A. Similarly for Blocks B and C. But since each row of the entire grid (rows 1-3) must contain x exactly once, x must appear exactly once in each row of the entire grid. Therefore, x must be in row 1 of one block, row 1 of another block, and row 1 of the third block? Wait, no. Wait, each row of the entire grid is row 1, which includes row 1 of Block A, row 1 of Block B, row 1 of Block C. So if x is in row 1 of Block A, it can't be in row 1 of Block B or C, because row 1 of the entire grid must have x only once. Therefore, x must be in exactly one of the three blocks' row 1. Similarly, x must be in exactly one of the three blocks' row 2, and exactly one of the three blocks' row 3.\n\nTherefore, for each number x, it appears once in each row (1, 2, 3) of the entire grid, but in different blocks. Therefore, the positions of x in the three blocks must be in different rows. Wait, no. Wait, x must appear once in each row of the entire grid, which is composed of the rows of the three blocks. So x must be in row 1 of one block, row 2 of another block, and row 3 of the third block. Therefore, for each x, it is located in each row (1,2,3) of the entire grid exactly once, but each time in a different block. Therefore, the positions of x in the three blocks must be in distinct rows. Therefore, for each x, there is a permutation of the blocks (A, B, C) such that x is in row i of block σ(i), where σ is a permutation of (A,B,C). Wait, maybe not exactly permutation, but each x is in row 1 of one block, row 2 of another, row 3 of the third.\n\nTherefore, for each number x, its position in the grid is such that it's in row 1 of one block, row 2 of another, row 3 of the third. Therefore, the placement of each number corresponds to a permutation of the blocks across the rows.\n\nThis seems similar to a Latin square. If we think of the blocks as columns and rows as rows, then for each number x, it must appear once in each row and once in each \"column\" (block). Therefore, forming a Latin square of order 3, where the rows are the grid rows and the columns are the blocks. Each cell in this Latin square corresponds to the position (row, block) where the number x is placed. Therefore, for each number x, we have a 3x3 Latin square where the rows correspond to the grid rows and the columns correspond to the blocks. Each Latin square indicates where the number x is placed: in block column j, grid row i.\n\nSince there are 9 numbers, each with such a Latin square, but the placements must not conflict.

Therefore, the assignment can be represented as a 3x3x3 tensor where each element is a triplet of numbers. However, ensuring that all numbers are unique across the entire grid complicates things.\n\nPerhaps another angle: Since each block is a 3x3 grid containing numbers 1-9, each block can be considered as a 3x3 matrix where each row is a 3-element subset, and the union of all three subsets is 1-9. Similarly, each entire row is a permutation formed by concatenating one subset from each block.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to arranging three 3x3 grids (Blocks A, B, C) such that:\n\n1. Each block's rows form a partition of 1-9.\n\n2. For each entire row i, the i-th row of each block forms a partition of 1-9.\n\nThis is equivalent to a pair of orthogonal set systems, perhaps.\n\nIn combinatorics, this is similar to an orthogonal array, but with set partitions. Specifically, we have two orthogonal partitions: one partition for the blocks (each block is a partition of 1-9 into three triples), and one partition for the entire rows (each entire row is a partition of 1-9 into three triples). These two partitions need to be orthogonal, meaning that the intersection of any triple from the block partition and any triple from the row partition is exactly one element.\n\nThis is analogous to orthogonal Latin squares, where each pair of symbols occurs exactly once. Here, each pair of triples (one from a block, one from a row) intersect in exactly one element.\n\nIf such a system exists, then the number of ways to arrange the grid would be based on the number of such orthogonal partitions.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure about the exact count here. Let's try to compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first block (Block A). We need to arrange numbers 1-9 into a 3x3 grid such that each row is a 3-element subset, and the union of the three rows is 1-9. The number of ways to do this for Block A is the number of ways to partition 1-9 into three triples and arrange them in order.

Therefore, for each number x, π_x is a permutation (A, B, C) -> (row1, row2, row3). Wait, no. It's a permutation of blocks assigned to each row. For example, π_x could be (A, B, C), meaning x is in block A in row1, block B in row2, block C in row3.

Specifically, if we create a 3x3 grid where each cell corresponds to a block and row, and we place three numbers in each cell such that each number appears exactly once per row and once per block. Wait, no. Wait, actually, each permutation π_x corresponds to a permutation matrix in a 3x3 grid, where each π_x indicates a position (i, j) where the number x is placed in block j, row i.

      "reasoning_step": "Wait, this is tricky. Let's think in terms of permutations.\n\nSuppose we have Block A arranged. For each row i of Block A, let S_i be the set of numbers in that row. Then, for each row i of the entire grid, the remaining numbers not in S_i must be split between Block B and Block C's row i. Let T_i = {1-9} \\ S_i. Then, Block B's row i and Block C's row i must form a partition of T_i into two triples. However, Block B and Block C must each contain all numbers 1-9. Therefore, the union of Block B's three rows must be 1-9, and similarly for Block C.\n\nTherefore, Block B must contain each number exactly once, and its rows must be such that for each row i, Block B's row i is a subset of T_i. Similarly for Block C.\n\nTherefore, Block B's rows must be a partition of 1-9 into three triples, each of which is a subset of T_1, T_2, T_3 respectively. Similarly for Block C.\n\nHowever, T_1, T_2, T_3 are each 6-element sets (since each S_i is 3 elements). Therefore, Block B's rows must be a triple from T_1, a triple from T_2, and a triple from T_3, such that their union is 1-9. Similarly for Block C.\n\nBut T_1 ∪ T_2 ∪ T_3 = {1-9} \\ (S_1 ∪ S_2 ∪ S_3) ∪ {1-9} = {1-9} since S_1 ∪ S_2 ∪ S_3 = {1-9}. Therefore, T_1, T_2, T_3 are each the complements of S_1, S_2, S_3 respectively.\n\nTherefore, Block B must be formed by selecting a triple from each T_i, such that the union of these triples is 1-9. Similarly for Block C.\n\nHowever, since Block B must contain each number exactly once, the triples selected from T_1, T_2, T_3 must be pairwise disjoint and their union must be 1-9. Similarly for Block C.\n\nBut T_i = {1-9} \\ S_i. Therefore, each number x in 1-9 appears in exactly two of the T_i's. Because x is in S_i for exactly one i (since each number is in exactly one S_i), so x is in T_j for j ≠ i. Therefore, each number x is in two of the T_i's.\n\nTherefore, for Block B, we need to select a triple from each T_i such that every number x is selected exactly once (since Block B must contain each x exactly once). Since each x is in two T_i's, we need to choose for each x, which T_i it will be selected from. This must be done such that for each T_i, exactly three numbers are chosen from it (forming a triple).\n\nThis is equivalent to finding a system of distinct representatives (SDR) for the sets T_1, T_2, T_3, where each SDR selects three elements from each T_i, and each element is selected exactly once.\n\nHowever, since each element x is in two T_i's, this is equivalent to a matching in a bipartite graph where one partition is the elements {1-9} and the other is the sets {T_1, T_2, T_3}, with edges connecting x to the T_i's it belongs to. We need to select three elements from each T_i such that every element is selected exactly once.\n\nThis is a 3-regular bipartite graph (each element appears in two T_i's, each T_i has six elements), and we need a 3-factor. However, counting such factors is non-trivial.\n\nThis seems too complex. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, after choosing Block A, the number of ways to choose Block B and Block C can be computed as follows:\n\nFor each row i, T_i has six elements. We need to partition T_i into two triples, one for Block B and one for Block C. The number of ways to partition T_i into two triples is C(6,3)/2 = 10 ways (since choosing three elements for Block B automatically assigns the remaining three to Block C, and dividing by 2 to account for swapping B and C).\n\nHowever, since the partitions must be consistent across all three rows to ensure that Block B and Block C each contain all numbers exactly once.\n\nFor example, after partitioning T_1 into B1 and C1, T_2 into B2 and C2, T_3 into B3 and C3, we must have that B1 ∪ B2 ∪ B3 = {1-9} and similarly for C1 ∪ C2 ∪ C3 = {1-9}.\n\nGiven that T_i = {1-9} \\ S_i, and S_1 ∪ S_2 ∪ S_3 = {1-9}, each number x is in exactly two of the T_i's. Therefore, for each x, it must be chosen in exactly one of the two T_i's it belongs to. This is equivalent to directing each x to the Block B or C in one of its two possible T_i's.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to assign numbers to Block B and C is 2^9, but this must be adjusted for overlapping constraints.\n\nHowever, this overcounts because the choices are not independent. For each row i, the choice of triples for Block B and C affects the availability for other rows.",

However, this doesn't directly apply.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, I think this problem is related to the number of Latin squares and orthogonal arrays. According to some references, the number of ways to arrange three rows of Sudoku without column constraints is 9! × 3!^6 × 2^3. However, I need to verify.\n\nLet me consider that:\n\n- First, arrange the first block: 9! ways.\n\n- For the second block, each row must avoid the numbers in the first block's corresponding row. For each row, there are 6 remaining numbers, which need to be arranged in the second block's row. However, the second block must contain all numbers 1-9, so across all three rows, it must include each number exactly once.\n\nTherefore, the second block is a derangement of the first block's rows, but scaled up. The number of ways to arrange the second block is 3!^3 × 2^3. Here, 3!^3 accounts for permuting the numbers within each triplet of the second block, and 2^3 accounts for swapping triplets between the second and third blocks.\n\nSimilarly, the third block is determined once the first two are set.\n\nTherefore, total number of grids would be 9! × 3!^3 × 2^3.\n\nCalculating this:\n\n9! = 362880\n\n3!^3 = 6^3 = 216\n\n2^3 = 8\n\nTotal: 362880 × 216 × 8 = 362880 × 1728 = 362880 × 1728\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n362880 × 1000 = 362,880,000\n\n362880 × 700 = 254,016,000\n\n362880 × 28 = 10,160,640\n\nTotal: 362,880,000 + 254,016,000 = 616,896,000 + 10,160,640 = 627,056,640\n\nSo 627,056,640.\n\nBut this is just a guess. However, according to some sources, the number of ways to arrange the first three rows of a Sudoku grid (which have column constraints) is 9! × 3!^6 × 2^3 = 362880 × 729 × 8 = 362880 × 5832 = 2,115,511,  but this doesn't align with my previous calculation.",

      "reasoning_step": "Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me check:\n\nIn Sudoku, the first row can be any permutation: 9!.\n\nThe second and third rows are constrained by the column and block constraints. However, in our problem, columns are not constrained, so the count should be higher.\n\nAlternatively, since each block must contain 1-9 and each row must contain 1-9, the number is:\n\nFirst block: 9! ways.\n\nFor each row in the first block, the numbers are fixed. For the second block, each row must contain the remaining 6 numbers, partitioned into two triples. However, the second block must also contain all numbers 1-9, so each number must appear exactly once in the second block across its three rows.\n\nTherefore, the assignment of numbers to the second block's rows must be such that each number not in the first block's corresponding row is placed exactly once in the second block. This is equivalent to a system of triples where each number appears in exactly one triple.\n\nThis is equivalent to a bipartite matching problem where each number not in the first block's row i must be assigned to exactly one of the second or third block's row i.\n\nThe number of ways to do this is (3!^3)^2 × 2^3. This comes from:\n\n- For each row, permuting the numbers within the block's row: 3!^3 for each block.\n\n- Choosing the order of the blocks: 2^3.\n\nTherefore, total number of grids is 9! × (3!^3)^2 × 2^3.\n\nCalculating:\n\n9! = 362880\n\n(3!^3)^2 = (6^3)^2 = 216^2 = 46656\n\n2^3 = 8\n\nTotal: 362880 × 46656 × 8\n\nFirst, 362880 × 8 = 2,903,040\n\n2,903,040 × 46,656 = ?\n\nLet me approximate:\n\n2,903,040 × 40,000 = 116,121,600,000\n\n2,903,040 × 6,656 = ?\n\n2,903,040 × 6,000 = 17,418,240,000\n\n2,903,040 × 656 = ?\n\n2,903,040 × 600 = 1,741,824,000\n\n2,903,040 × 56 = 162,570,240\n\nTotal: 1,741,824,000 + 162,570,240 = 1,904,394,240\n\nSo total: 116,121,600,000 + 17,418,240,000 + 1,904,394,240 = 135,444,234,240\n\nBut this number seems very large. The problem states that the answer can be written as p^a·q^b·r^c·s^d with distinct primes. Let's factorize 362880 × 46656 × 8.\n\nFirst, factorize each component:\n\n9! = 362880 = 2^7 × 3^4 × 5 × 7\n\n3!^3 = 6^3 = (2×3)^3 = 2^3 × 3^3\n\nSo (3!^3)^2 = (2^3 × 3^3)^2 = 2^6 × 3^6\n\n2^3 = 2^3\n\nTherefore, total factorization:\n\n2^7 × 3^4 × 5 × 7 × 2^6 × 3^6 × 2^3 = 2^(7+6+3) × 3^(4+6) × 5 × 7 = 2^16 × 3^10 × 5 × 7\n\nSo the prime factors are 2, 3, 5, 7 with exponents 16, 10, 1, 1 respectively.\n\nThen, the problem asks for p·a + q·b + r·c + s·d, where p, q, r, s are distinct primes and a, b, c, d are exponents.\n\nIn this factorization, primes are 2, 3, 5, 7 with exponents 16, 10, 1, 1.\n\nSo p=2, a=16; q=3, b=10; r=5, c=1; s=7, d=1.\n\nTherefore, the sum is 2×16 + 3×10 + 5×1 + 7×1 = 32 + 30 + 5 + 7 = 74.\n\nHowever, I need to verify if this factorization is correct.
