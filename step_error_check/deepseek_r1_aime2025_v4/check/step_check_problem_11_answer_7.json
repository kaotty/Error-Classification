Since f(x) is periodic with period 4, its graph repeats every 4 units along the x-axis. The basic shape from -1 to 3 is a line from (-1, -1) up to (1, 1), then down to (3, -1), and so on.\n\nTo find intersection points between x = 34y² and f(x), we need to set x = f(x) where x is given by the piecewise function. Wait, no. Wait, the parabola is x = 34y², so for each y, x is 34y². But f(x) is a function of x, so f(x) gives y. Wait, maybe I need to think of this as solving for x and y such that y = f(x) and x = 34y². So substituting x = 34y² into y = f(x), we get y = f(34y²). So, we need to solve y = f(34y²). Since f is periodic with period 4, f(34y²) is equal to f(34y² mod 4). So first, let's compute 34y² mod 4. Since 34 divided by 4 is 8*4 = 32, remainder 2. So 34y² ≡ 2y² mod 4.

Wait, the original definition says f(x) is defined as x on [-1,1), 2 - x on [1,3), and then repeats every 4. So, for any real x, f(x) = f(x + 4k) where k is integer such that x + 4k is in [-1, 3).

Wait, 34 divided by 4 is 8.5, so 34y² = 4*8y² + 2y². Therefore, 34y² mod 4 is 2y² mod 4. But since 4 is the period, the value of f(34y²) is equal to f(2y²). However, we need to adjust 2y² into the interval [-1, 3). Hmm, but 2y² could be outside of [-1, 3). Wait, perhaps I need to subtract multiples of 4 until the result is in [-1, 3). So, let's denote z = 34y². Then, z mod 4 is equivalent to z - 4*floor(z/4 + 1/4). Wait, maybe another approach. Let's compute 34y² divided by 4, find the fractional part multiplied by 4. Wait, perhaps it's easier to write 34y² = 4k + t, where t is in [-1, 3). Then f(34y²) = f(t). So t = 34y² - 4k. Depending on the value of t, we apply the appropriate piecewise definition.",

Alternatively, for each n, we can find possible y's such that 34y² is in [4n -1, 4n +3). Because r = 34y² -4n ∈ [-1,3) implies that 34y² ∈ [4n -1, 4n +3). Therefore, y² ∈ [(4n -1)/34, (4n +3)/34).

So n can be 0,1,2,... such that (4n -1)/34 ≤ y² < (4n +3)/34 and y² ≥0.\n\nTherefore, possible n's start from n=0 upwards.

The n is determined by the interval that x=34y² falls into. For x=34y², which is in [4n -1,4n +3). So for x=34y²=4n +r, where r ∈ [-1,3). So if x=34y²=4n +r, then r=x -4n ∈ [-1,3). Therefore, n is floor((x +1)/4). But perhaps when solving Case 1 and Case 2, we need to check whether the solutions y satisfy x=34y² ∈ [4n -1,4n +3). So maybe when we solve Case 1: y = r =x -4n, which implies x= y +4n. But x=34y², so 34y² = y +4n. Similarly, for Case 2: y=2 -r=2 - (x -4n)=2 -x +4n, so x=2 -y +4n. Then x=34y²=2 -y +4n.\n\nTherefore, solving these equations gives possible y's, but we need to check that x=34y² is in [4n -1,4n +3). Which translates to:\n\nFor Case 1: x=34y²= y +4n ∈ [4n -1,4n +3). Therefore, y +4n ∈ [4n -1,4n +3). Subtract 4n: y ∈ [-1,3). But y is from Case 1 equation: y=34y² -4n. So y= r ∈ [-1,1). Therefore, the valid interval for y in Case 1 is [-1,1). Similarly, for Case 2: x=34y²=2 -y +4n ∈ [4n -1,4n +3). So 2 -y +4n ∈ [4n -1,4n +3). Subtract 4n: 2 -y ∈ [-1,3). Therefore, y ∈ (-1,3]. But since y=2 -r and r ∈ [1,3), then y=2 -r ∈ (-1,1]. So y ∈ (-1,1]. Therefore, when solving Case 2, solutions y must lie in (-1,1].\n\nBut earlier, when solving Case 1 and Case 2 equations, we found solutions for y, but need to check if they lie within these intervals.\n\nWait, perhaps this is a better approach:\n\nFor Case 1: y = 34y² -4n, and y ∈ [-1,1).\n\nFor Case 2: y = 2 - (34y² -4n) ⇒ y = 2 -34y² +4n, and y ∈ (-1,1].\n\nTherefore, when solving Case 1 and Case 2 equations, we must check if the solutions y lie within [-1,1) and (-1,1] respectively.\n\nThis might restrict the number of valid solutions.\n\nLet's revisit n=9:\n\nCase 1 equation:34y² - y -36=0. Solutions y≈1.044 and y≈-1.014. But y must be in [-1,1). So y≈1.044 is outside, y≈-1.014 is also outside (since -1.014 < -1). Therefore, no solutions for Case 1, n=9.\n\nCase 2 equation:34y² + y -34=0. Solutions y≈0.985 and y≈-1.015. y≈0.985 is within (-1,1], valid. y≈-1.015 is outside. Check x=34y²=34*(0.985)^2≈34*0.97≈32.98. Then x=32.98. Which should be in [4n -1,4n +3). For n=9: [36 -1,36 +3)=[35,39). But 32.98 is not in [35,39). Therefore, invalid. Hence, even though y≈0.985 is within (-1,1], x=34y²≈32.98 is not in [35,39). Therefore, invalid. Hence, no solutions for n=9.\n\nTherefore, the valid solutions are only up to n=8.\n\nSimilarly, for n=8, Case 1 solutions y≈0.985 and y≈-0.955. Both y's are within [-1,1). Check x=34y²≈34*(0.985)^2≈34*0.97≈32.98, which should be in [4*8 -1,4*8 +3)=[32 -1,32 +3)=[31,35). 32.98 is in [31,35). Valid.\n\nSimilarly, x=34*(-0.955)^2≈34*(0.912)≈31.0, which is also in [31,35).

      "reasoning_step": "But in our earlier analysis, for each n≥1, the quadratic equation34y² -y -4n=0 has two solutions: one positive and one negative. However, when substituting these into f(x), since x=34y² is the same for both y and -y, but f(x) is either x or 2 -x depending on the interval. Wait, but x=34y² is the same for y and -y. Therefore, f(x) is fixed for that x. So if f(x)=y, then for the negative counterpart, we would need f(x)=-y. But unless f(x)=0, this is not possible. Therefore, unless y=0, the points (x,y) and (x,-y) cannot both be solutions unless f(x)=y and f(x)=-y, which implies y=0.\n\nTherefore, except for y=0, all other solutions must come in pairs where y and y' are such that x=34y² and x=34y'² are different, leading to different f(x) values. However, in our case, since x=34y² is determined by y, for each solution y, x is fixed, and f(x) is fixed. Therefore, if y is a solution, then f(x)=y, but -y would require f(x)=-y, which is only possible if y=0.\n\nTherefore, except for y=0, all solutions are either positive or negative, but not symmetric. Hence, the sum does not cancel out, and the total sum includes all these positive and negative y's.\n\nBut in our previous calculation, we used the fact that the sum of roots for each quadratic equation is1/34, but that may not account for the actual validity of both roots.\n\nWait, but in the earlier detailed analysis, for each n from1 to8, both roots of the quadratic equation were valid, i.e., both positive and negative y's satisfied the r ∈ [-1,1) condition. For example, n=1:\n\ny≈0.358 and y≈-0.328. Both resulted in r≈0.352 and r≈-0.362, which are in [-1,1). Therefore, both solutions are valid. Therefore, their sum is indeed1/34.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2:\n\ny=1/2 and y≈-0.4706. Both valid, sum=1/2 +(-0.4706)=0.0294≈1/34≈0.0294.\n\nWait, 1/34≈0.0294. So sum for n=2 is1/34.\n\nSimilarly, for other n's, the sum of the two roots is1/34, even though individually they are not symmetric.\n\nTherefore, the total sum S=1/34 (from n=0) +8*(1/34)=9/34.\n\nBut the problem states the sum can be expressed in the form(a +b√c)/d, which suggests that there are radicals in the expression. Therefore, there must be an error in assuming that the sum of the roots for each quadratic equation contributes1/34. But why?\n\nWait, perhaps the equations for Case 1 and Case 2 both contribute to the sum. However, in our analysis, Case 2 didn't contribute any solutions. But let's verify again.\n\nFor example, take n=1:\n\nCase 2 equation:34y² + y -2=0. Solutions≈0.228 and≈-0.258. But when plugged back, x=34y²≈34*(0.228)^2≈34*0.052≈1.768. Then r=x -4*1=1.768 -4≈-2.232, which is not in [1,3). Therefore, invalid.\n\nSimilarly, for other n's, Case 2 solutions do not satisfy the r ∈ [1,3) condition. Therefore, Case 2 does not contribute any valid solutions.\n\nThus, the total sum S=9/34≈0.2647.\n\nBut the problem says the sum can be expressed as(a +b√c)/d. However,9/34 is a rational number, which can be written as(9 +0√1)/34, but c=1 is square-free. However, the problem specifies that a,b,c,d are positive integers, and c is not divisible by the square of any prime. If c=1, which is acceptable, then a=9, b=0, c=1, d=34. Therefore, a+b+c+d=9+0+1+34=44.\n\nBut the problem might expect us to consider that the sum includes terms with square roots, implying that perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWhere is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. The problem says the sum of the y-coordinates of the intersection points. Each intersection point is (x,y), so we need to sum all y's where x=34y² and y=f(x).\n\nBut f(x) is periodic, so x=34y² can be expressed as x=4n +r where r ∈ [-1,3). Therefore, y=f(x)=f(r). So y=r if r ∈ [-1,1), y=2 -r if r ∈ [1,3).\n\nTherefore, substituting x=34y²=4n +r, and y=r or y=2 -r.\n\nTherefore:\n\nIf r ∈ [-1,1), then y=r, so x=4n +r=34r².\n\nIf r ∈ [1,3), then y=2 -r, so x=4n +r=34(2 -r)².\n\nTherefore, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1:r ∈ [-1,1), y=r, and 4n +r=34r².\n\nCase 2:r ∈ [1,3), y=2 -r, and 4n +r=34(2 -r)².\n\nTherefore, solving for r in each case:\n\nCase 1:34r² -r -4n=0, r ∈ [-1,1).\n\nCase 2:34(2 -r)² -r -4n=0, r ∈ [1,3).\n\nThen, y=r or y=2 -r accordingly.\n\nTherefore, the sum of y-coordinates is the sum of r's from Case 1 plus the sum of (2 -r)'s from Case 2.\n\nBut earlier analysis found that Case 2 does not contribute any solutions, but perhaps this approach will clarify.\n\nLet's proceed:\n\nCase 1:34r² -r -4n=0, r ∈ [-1,1).\n\nFor each integer n≥0, solve for r.\n\nSimilarly, Case 2:34(2 -r)² -r -4n=0, r ∈ [1,3).\n\nFor each integer n≥0, solve for r.\n\nThen, y=r or y=2 -r.\n\nLet's first handle Case 1:\n\n34r² -r -4n=0.\n\nThis is the same equation as before. For each n, solutions r=(1 ±√(1 +544n))/68.\n\nBut r must be in [-1,1).\n\nSimilarly, for Case 2:\n\n34(2 -r)² -r -4n=0.\n\nExpand:\n\n34(4 -4r +r²) -r -4n=0 ⇒136 -136r +34r² -r -4n=0 ⇒34r² -137r +136 -4n=0.\n\nSolve for r:\n\nr = [137 ±√(137² -4*34*(136 -4n))]/(2*34).\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\nD=137² -4*34*(136 -4n)=18769 -4*34*136 +16*34n=18769 -18496 +544n=273 +544n.\n\nThus, r=[137 ±√(273 +544n)]/68.\n\nBut r must be in [1,3).\n\nTherefore, for each n≥0, solve r=[137 ±√(273 +544n)]/68 and check if r ∈ [1,3).\n\nNow, let's find possible n's for Case 2.\n\nFor r ∈ [1,3), then:\n\n34(2 -r)² -r -4n=0 ⇒4n=34(2 -r)² -r.\n\nSince r ∈ [1,3), let's set s=2 -r ∈ (-1,1].\n\nThen,4n=34s² - (2 -s)=34s² +s -2.\n\nTherefore,4n=34s² +s -2.\n\nSince s ∈ (-1,1], and n must be integer ≥0.\n\nLet's find possible s values:\n\nFor s=1:4n=34*1 +1 -2=33 ⇒n=33/4=8.25. Not integer.\n\ns=0.9:34*(0.81)+0.9 -2≈27.54 +0.9 -2≈26.44 ⇒n≈6.61. Not integer.\n\ns=0.5:34*(0.25)+0.5 -2=8.5 +0.5 -2=7 ⇒n=7/4=1.75. Not integer.\n\ns=0:34*0 +0 -2=-2 ⇒n negative. Invalid.\n\ns approaching -1: s=-1:4n=34*1 +(-1) -2=34 -3=31⇒n=31/4=7.75. Not integer.\n\nTherefore, there are no integer n's for which Case 2 has solutions. Hence, Case 2 does not contribute any solutions.\n\nTherefore, only Case 1 contributes, and the sum is9/34.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the answer should be in the form(a +b√c)/d. However,9/34 is a rational number. Therefore, unless there's an error in the problem statement or my analysis, this suggests that the answer is9/34, which would be expressed as(9 +0√1)/34, leading to a+b+c+d=9+0+1+34=44.\n\nBut the problem mentions \"the sum of the y-coordinates of these intersection points can be expressed in the form...\", implying that there are radicals involved.

Close enough considering rounding.\n\nBut earlier analysis using n instead of k found that for n=0, Case2 solutions were invalid, but this seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from using different variables. Previously, I used n as the integer such that x=34y² ∈[4n -1,4n +3). Here, k is the integer such that x=4k +r. Therefore, k here corresponds to n in the previous analysis.\n\nBut in this parametrization, for k=0, Case2 gives valid solutions. Therefore, my previous analysis missed these solutions.\n\nThis is the mistake! Earlier, I considered n such that x=34y² ∈[4n -1,4n +3), leading to solving for y in terms of n. However, when k=0 in Case2, x=r∈[1,3), which is part of the same period as k=0. Therefore, these solutions were not considered in the previous analysis because I was incrementing n based on x=34y²'s magnitude, but actually, for k=0, x can be in [-1,3), which includes [1,3) for Case2.\n\nTherefore, the previous analysis missed the Case2 solutions for k=0.\n\nSimilarly, for higher k's, there might be solutions in Case2.\n\nTherefore, the total solutions include both Case1 and Case2 for each k.\n\nLet's redo the analysis properly.\n\nFor each k≥0:\n\nCase1:r ∈[-1,1), solve34r² -r -4k=0.\n\nCase2:r ∈[1,3), solve34(2 -r)² -r -4k=0.\n\nThen, y=r or y=2 -r accordingly.\n\nNow, let's handle k=0:\n\nCase1:r=0 and r=1/34. y=0 and y=1/34.\n\nCase2:r≈1.771 and≈2.258. y≈0.229 and≈-0.258.\n\nBut need to check if these solutions are valid.\n\nFor r≈1.771: x=r≈1.771. Then x=34y²=34*(0.229)^2≈34*0.052≈1.768≈1.771. Close enough.\n\nSimilarly, y≈-0.258: x=34*(-0.258)^2≈34*0.066≈2.244≈r≈2.258. Valid.\n\nTherefore, these are valid solutions.\n\nSimilarly, for k=0, Case2 gives two solutions.\n\nPreviously, these were not considered because in the earlier approach, n was determined by x=34y²'s magnitude. But here, k=0 allows x to be in [1,3), leading to valid solutions.\n\nTherefore, the total number of solutions is higher.\n\nProceeding with this correct approach:\n\nFor each k≥0:\n\nSolve Case1 and Case2 equations for r ∈[-1,1) and [1,3).\n\nSum the y-coordinates accordingly.\n\nLet's start with k=0:\n\nCase1:\n\n34r² -r=0 ⇒r=0,1/34.

Wait, approximate calculation might not be accurate.\n\nActually, let's compute symbolically.\n\nEquation for Case2 when k=0:34(2 -r)² -r=0.\n\nLet’s denote s=2 -r, then r=2 -s.\n\nEquation becomes34s² - (2 -s)=0 ⇒34s² +s -2=0.\n\nSolutions:s=(-1 ±√(1 +272))/68=(-1 ±√273)/68.\n\ns=(-1 +√273)/68≈(-1 +16.52)/68≈15.52/68≈0.228.\n\ns=(-1 -√273)/68≈-17.52/68≈-0.258.\n\nThus, s=0.228 and s=-0.258.\n\nBut s=2 -r, so r=2 -s.\n\nFor s=0.228:r=2 -0.228=1.772. y=2 -r=0.228.\n\nFor s=-0.258:r=2 -(-0.258)=2.258. y=2 -r= -0.258.\n\nTherefore, sum of y's for Case2:0.228 +(-0.258)= -0.03.\n\nBut exact values:\n\ns=(-1 +√273)/68.\n\nThus, y=2 -r=2 -(2 -s)=s=(-1 +√273)/68.\n\nSimilarly, for the other solution:\n\ns=(-1 -√273)/68.\n\ny=2 -r=2 -(2 -s)=s=(-1 -√273)/68.\n\nTherefore, sum of y's for Case2, k=0:\n\n[(-1 +√273)/68] +[(-1 -√273)/68]= (-2)/68= -1/34.\n\nTherefore, total sum for k=0:\n\nCase1:1/34.\n\nCase2:-1/34.\n\nTotal:1/34 -1/34=0.",
