Additionally, each row contains each number exactly once. Therefore, each number appears once per row and once per block. Hence, each number must be placed in three different cells, each in a different row and a different block.\n\nTherefore, the arrangement is equivalent to a system where each number is assigned to three cells, forming a transversal across the rows and blocks. The entire grid is then a collection of nine such transversals, one for each number, with no overlaps.\n\nThis is similar to a 3-dimensional matching problem, which is NP-hard, but perhaps there's a known formula for this specific case.\n\nAccording to some references, the number of such Sudoku bands (first three rows) is 9! × 72^3. Let's accept this for a moment and check the prime factors.\n\nCompute 9! × 72^3.\n\nFirst, factorize each component:\n\n9! = 362880 = 2^7 × 3^4 × 5 × 7\n\n72 = 8 × 9 = 2^3 × 3^2\n\n72^3 = (2^3 × 3^2)^3 = 2^9 × 3^6\n\nTherefore, 9! × 72^3 = (2^7 × 3^4 × 5 × 7) × (2^9 × 3^6) = 2^(7+9) × 3^(4+6) × 5 × 7 = 2^16 × 3^10 × 5 × 7\n\nTherefore, the prime factors are 2, 3, 5, 7 with exponents 16, 10, 1, 1 respectively.\n\nThus, p=2, a=16; q=3, b=10; r=5, c=1; s=7, d=1.\n\nThen, p*a + q*b + r*c + s*d = 2*16 + 3*10 + 5*1 + 7*1 = 32 + 30 + 5 + 7 = 74.",

They break it down as follows:\n\n- The first 3x3 block can be filled in 9! ways.\n\n- The second block involves assigning the numbers to rows such that no number is in the same row as it was in the first block. This is equivalent to a derangement of the rows for each number. However, since there are three rows, the derangement is a permutation of the rows with no fixed points. The number of such derangements for three elements is 2. However, since each number must be deranged independently, but they must collectively form a Latin square.\n\nWait, perhaps not. The authors state that for each of the three rows in the first block, the numbers in that row must be redistributed into the other two rows in the second block.

For each of the three rows in the first block, the three numbers must be distributed to the other two rows in the second block. For one row, the number of ways to distribute three numbers into two other rows, with each row getting at least one number, is 6 (which is 3! ways). Since there are three rows, it's 6^3 = 216. However, this overcounts because it allows multiple numbers from the same original row to go to the same new row. But we need each row in the second block to have exactly three numbers. Therefore, the distribution must be such that each row in the second block receives three numbers, one from each row of the first block.
