Similarly, angle at E (60°) subtends arc DF, so arc DF is 120°, and angle at F (36°) subtends arc DE, so arc DE is 72°. Wait, so arc DE is 72°, arc EF is 168°, arc FD is 120°?

For an external point B the product of distances along one secant equals the product along any other secant through B. Here the secants through B meet the circle at {D,G} and at {F,J} (since AF = AB is the secant through F and J), so the correct relation is BD·BG = BF·BJ. The step wrote BD·BG = BF·BE, which mixes points from different lines (BE is not the second intersection on the BF-secant) and thus is incorrect. The remark about BT^2 - r^2 is a correct alternative formula but is not pursued; no numerical consequences are derived.\",\n    \"Method_Consistency\": false,\n    \"Step_Relation\": [\n        {\n            \"Parent_Step\": \"Step 16\",\n            \"Relation\": \"Progressive\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"Parent_Step\": \"Step 19\",\n            \"Relation\": \"Progressive\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"Summary\": \"Attempt power of a point: propose BD·BG = BF·BE (incorrect)\"\n}\n</output>"

But we need the other intersection point H, which should be beyond E? Wait, but parametrizing from A to E, t=1 is E. If t≈0.1398 is between A and E, but E is already on the circle. Wait, but E is a midpoint and on the circle DEF. Therefore, line AE intersects the circle at E and H. So H is another intersection point. But according to the calculation, t≈0.1398 is between A and E, but E is at t=1. Wait, this seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps parametrization is from A to E, but the line AE extends beyond E, so t can be greater than 1. But our parametrization was x = A_x + t*(E_x - A_x), y = A_y + t*(E_y - A_y). So when t=0, it's A; t=1, it's E. But the other intersection point H should be beyond E (t > 1). But according to the quadratic solution, t≈1.005 and t≈0.1398. So t≈1.005 is just beyond E, and t≈0.1398 is between A and E. But since E is already on the circle, the other intersection is at t≈1.005, very close to E. But due to calculation approximations, maybe it's exactly E at t=1? Wait, but E is on the circle, so substituting t=1 into the parametric equations should satisfy the circle equation.\n\nCheck if E is on the circle:\n\nE is (0.64785, 0.25575).
