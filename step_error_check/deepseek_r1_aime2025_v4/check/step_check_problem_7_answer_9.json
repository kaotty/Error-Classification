Since all pairs are ordered alphabetically, the first letter is the earlier one. Therefore, the lex greatest word is the pair with the highest possible first letter, and then the highest possible second letter given that first letter.\n\nGiven that, the highest possible first letter is K (since K can pair with L to form KL). If KL is formed, then KL is the last word, and G is not in KL. Therefore, in order for G to be in the last word, KL must not be formed. Then, the next highest possible first letter is J. The highest word starting with J would be JL (if J is paired with L), otherwise JK (if J is paired with K), etc. Similarly, if J is paired with a lower letter, then the highest second letter possible.\n\nBut G is a specific letter. So, for G to be in the last word, either:\n\n1. G is paired with L, forming GL, which would be ordered as GL. Then, GL would be the last word if there are no pairs with a higher first letter than G. But G is the 7th letter. Letters after G are H, I, J, K, L. So, if any of those letters (H to L) are paired with letters after them, forming pairs starting with H, I, J, K, then those pairs would come after GL.\n\nAlternatively, if G is paired with a letter higher than G, say H, I, J, K, or L. Then, the pair would be ordered as G followed by the higher letter. For example, pairing G with H gives GH, pairing G with L gives GL. Then, the word GL would be higher than GH, GI, GJ, GK, GL.\n\nBut GL's position in the overall list depends on whether there are pairs starting with letters higher than G. For example, if there's a pair starting with H, I, J, K, then those would come after GL. Therefore, GL can only be the last word if there are no pairs starting with H, I, J, K, or L (but L cannot start a pair unless paired with someone after L, which doesn't exist). Wait, but pairs starting with K would only be KL. Similarly, pairs starting with J would be JL or JK, etc.",

Similarly, I can be paired with A-F, H, J, K, resulting in pairs starting with A-F, H, or I (if paired with J or K: IJ, IK). Wait, no—if I is paired with J, since I comes before J, the pair is IJ. If I is paired with K, it's IK. So, pairs starting with I would be IJ, IK. Similarly, J paired with K is JK.\n\nTherefore, in the remaining letters (A-F, H, I, J, K), the pairs starting with H, I, J, K are HI, HJ, HK, IJ, IK, JK. All other pairs would start with A-F.\n\nTherefore, for there to be no pairs starting with H, I, J, K, we must pair all H, I, J, K with letters from A-F. Because if any of H, I, J, K is paired with another letter from H, I, J, K, then the pair would start with H, I, J, or K.\n\nTherefore, the condition for GL to be the maximum pair is that all H, I, J, K are paired with A-F. So, H, I, J, K must each be paired with someone from A-F. Since there are 4 letters (H, I, J, K) and 6 letters (A-F). So, we need to pair each of H, I, J, K with someone from A-F, and the remaining 2 letters from A-F are paired among themselves.\n\nThe number of ways to do this is: First, choose 4 letters from A-F to pair with H, I, J, K. The number of ways is C(6, 4) * 4! (since we assign each of H, I, J, K to one of the 4 chosen letters). Then, the remaining 2 letters from A-F are paired together, and the remaining 0 letters from H, I, J, K (since all are paired). Wait, but H, I, J, K are 4 letters, and we pair each with a distinct letter from A-F (which has 6). So, we need to choose 4 distinct letters from A-F and pair them with H, I, J, K. The number of ways is P(6, 4) = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3. Then, the remaining 2 letters from A-F can be paired in 1 way (since order doesn't matter). Wait, but pairings are unordered. So, actually, the number of ways is:\n\nFirst, choose 4 letters from A-F: C(6, 4).\n\nThen, assign each of H, I, J, K to one of these 4 letters: 4! ways.\n\nThen, pair the remaining 2 letters from A-F: 1 way.\n\nBut actually, in terms of perfect matchings, the total number of ways to pair the remaining 10 letters is (10)! / (2^5 5!). However, the number of favorable pairings where H, I, J, K are all paired with A-F is:\n\nFirst, pair H, I, J, K with 4 distinct letters from A-F. The number of ways is C(6, 4) * 4! * (2)! / (2^1 1!) ). Wait, no. Let's think differently.\n\nTotal number of ways to pair the remaining 10 letters: 9!! = 945 (since 10 letters can be paired in 9*7*5*3*1 = 945 ways).\n\nNumber of favorable ways: We need to pair H, I, J, K each with someone from A-F, and the remaining two from A-F are paired together.\n\nTo compute this:\n\nFirst, pair H with someone from A-F: 6 choices.\n\nThen, pair I with someone from the remaining 5 in A-F: 5 choices.\n\nThen, pair J with someone from the remaining 4 in A-F: 4 choices.\n\nThen, pair K with someone from the remaining 3 in A-F: 3 choices.\n\nThen, pair the remaining 2 letters in A-F: 1 way.\n\nHowever, this counts the number of ordered pairings. Since pairings are unordered, we need to divide by the number of orderings of the pairs. But since we are counting distinct pairings, actually, this product (6*5*4*3*1) is equal to 6*5*4*3 = 360.

So, possible partners are A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K, L.\n\nBut when G is paired with someone before G (A-F), then the pair would be ordered as (partner, G), since partner comes before G. For example, if G is paired with A, the pair is AG.\n\nIn this case, AG starts with A. For AG to be the maximum pair, all other pairs must start with letters before A, which is impossible.

Each of these pairs, when formed, has a certain probability of being the maximum pair, which we calculated as 8/21 for each, given that G is paired with that specific letter.\n\nTherefore, total probability is 5*(1/11)*(8/21) = 40/231 ≈ 0.173, which is approximately 17.3%.\n\nBut let me verify this with a smaller case to see if the approach holds.\n\nSuppose we have only 4 letters: A, B, C, D. We want the probability that the last word contains B.\n\nPossible pairings:\n\nPossible pairings are:\n\n1. AB, CD\n\n2. AC, BD\n\n3. AD, BC\n\n4. BC, AD\n\n5. BD, AC\n\n6. CD, AB\n\nWait, but actually, the number of pairings is 3 for 4 letters. Wait, no: for 4 letters, the number of pairings is 3. For example:\n\n1. (AB, CD)\n\n2. (AC, BD)\n\n3. (AD, BC)\n\nEach of these has two pairs. Then, ordered alphabetically:\n\nFor pairing 1: AB, CD. Sorted: AB, CD. Last word is CD, which contains D.\n\nPairing 2: AC, BD. Sorted: AC, BD. Last word is BD, contains B.\n\nPairing 3: AD, BC. Sorted: AD, BC. Last word is BC, contains B.\n\nSo, out of 3 possible pairings, in two of them the last word contains B. Therefore, probability is 2/3.\n\nUsing our formula:\n\nLetters are A, B, C, D. We want the probability that the last word contains B.\n\nPossible pairs involving B: BA, BC, BD. Ordered as AB, BC, BD.\n\nThe maximum pair can be CD, BD, BC, or AD, etc.\n\nBut according to our previous approach:\n\nFor B to be in the last pair, B must be paired with C or D.\n\nIf B is paired with C: BC. For BC to be the maximum pair, there must be no pairs starting with C or D. The remaining letters are A and D. Pairing A and D gives AD, which starts with A. Therefore, BC would be the maximum pair. So, if B is paired with C, probability BC is maximum is 1.\n\nSimilarly, if B is paired with D: BD. Remaining letters are A and C. Pair AC or CA, which is AC. So, BD is greater than AC. Therefore, BD is the maximum pair.\n\nIf B is paired with A: AB. Remaining pairs are CD or others. CD is greater than AB. Therefore, AB is not the maximum.\n\nTherefore, when B is paired with C or D (probability 2/3), the pair is maximum. Therefore, probability is 2/3, which matches the actual count.\n\nUsing our formula:\n\nNumber of possible partners after B: C, D (2 letters).\n\nFor each partner, probability B pairs with them is 1/3 (since 3 partners: A, C, D).\n\nGiven pairing with C, probability BC is maximum: remaining letters A and D must be paired as AD. So, number of favorable pairings: 1 (AD). Total pairings: 1 (since only one way to pair A and D). Therefore, probability 1/1 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, pairing B with D: remaining letters A and C can only pair as AC. Probability BD is maximum: 1.\n\nTherefore, total probability: (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*1 = 2/3.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nIn this case, our formula works. So, extending this to the original problem, the approach seems valid.\n\nTherefore, returning to the original problem, the answer should be 40/231, so m + n = 271.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{271}\n",
