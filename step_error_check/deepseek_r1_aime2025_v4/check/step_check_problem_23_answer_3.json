    "problem": "From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $ N $ cents, where $ N $ is a positive integer. He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.",

      "reasoning_step": "First, let me understand what the problem is asking. The greedy algorithm isn't always optimal for coin systems. For example, in the US, with 1, 5, 10, 25, the greedy algorithm works, but if you change the denominations, sometimes it doesn't. Here, the denominations are 1, 10, 25. So, the question is: For which N from 1 to 1000 is the greedy algorithm's solution the one with the fewest coins possible?\n\nThe example given is 42 cents. The greedy method gives 25 + 10 + 7*1 = 9 coins, but there's a better way: 4*10 + 2*1 = 6 coins. So, 42 is a value where the greedy algorithm fails. Therefore, we need to count all N where this doesn't happen—i.e., where the greedy approach gives the minimal number of coins.\n\nSo, to solve this, I need to check for each N from 1 to 1000 whether the greedy solution is indeed the optimal. If yes, count it. The total count is the answer.\n\nBut checking each N individually would be tedious, especially since N can be up to 1000. There must be a pattern or mathematical way to determine when the greedy algorithm fails and when it succeeds.\n\nLet me recall that for a coin system to be canonical (i.e., where the greedy algorithm works for all N), certain conditions must hold. However, since our coin system isn't canonical (as shown by the example with 42), we need to find for which N the greedy algorithm still works.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem arises when using a combination of lower denominations can give the same total with fewer coins. Let's think about how the greedy algorithm proceeds:\n\nFor any N, the greedy approach is:\n\n1. Use as many 25-cent coins as possible without exceeding N.\n2. Then use as many 10-cent coins as possible with the remaining amount.\n3. Then use 1-cent coins for the remainder.",

If instead, we remove the 25 and the 10, which total 35, and replace them with 35 cents using 3*10 + 5*1, that would be 3 + 5 = 8 coins, which is worse than 25 +10 (2 coins). So that's not helpful. But in the example, they actually didn't remove both 25 and 10, but instead used more 10s. Wait, maybe the key is that when N mod 25 is such that using more 10s instead of 25 + 10(s) gives a better result.\n\nWait, perhaps when the remainder after dividing by 25 is between 10 and 24, using 10s and 1s is better, but sometimes combining with a 25 might lead to fewer coins.\n\nWait, let's think about how the remainder works. Let's suppose N = 25*q + r, where 0 ≤ r <25. Then, the greedy algorithm would use q quarters, and then proceed greedily on r.\n\nBut if r is, say, 20, then the greedy on 20 would use two dimes (10s), which is 2 coins, but if we used 20 pennies, that's 20 coins. So, clearly, greedy works here.\n\nBut wait, if we have N = 30. Greedy would be 25 + 5*1 = 6 coins. But optimal is 3*10 = 3 coins. So here, replacing the 25 with 2.5 tens isn't possible, but using 3*10 is better. So, in this case, the remainder after 25 is 5, but since 30 is 25 +5, but also 3*10. So, here, the problem arises when N can be expressed as a multiple of 10 with higher value than using 25 + remainder.\n\nSo, perhaps when N is a multiple of 10, but higher than some threshold, the optimal solution uses more 10s instead of a 25 and some 1s or 10s.\n\nWait, let's take N = 30. Greedy: 25 + 5*1 = 6 coins. Optimal: 3*10 = 3 coins. So, greedy uses 6 coins, optimal uses 3. So, greedy fails here.\n\nSimilarly, N = 40: greedy is 25 + 10 + 5*1 = 25 +10 +5 = 40. Coins: 1 +1 +5=7. Optimal: 4*10 = 4 coins. So, greedy uses 7, optimal uses 4. So, greedy fails here.\n\nWait, but N=25: greedy is 1 quarter, optimal is 1 quarter. So, works.\n\nN=10: greedy is 1 dime, works.\n\nN=15: greedy is 1 dime +5 pennies=6 coins. Optimal is same. So, no better way.\n\nWait, N=20: greedy is 2 dimes=2 coins.

The arithmetic about r=17 (greedy remainder = 1 dime + 7 pennies = 8 coins) is correct, but the inference that this rules out better overall solutions is invalid.\",\n    \"Method_Consistency\": true,\n    \"Step_Relation\": [\n        {\n            \"Parent_Step\": \"Step 8\",\n            \"Relation\": \"Progressive\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"Parent_Step\": \"Step 2\",\n            \"Relation\": \"Progressive\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"Summary\": \"Claim greedy optimal for remainder r; r=17 → 1d+7p (8 coins)\"\n}\n</output>"

      "reasoning_step": "Wait, N=42. Greedy: 25 +10 +7*1= 1+1+7=9 coins. Optimal:4*10 +2*1=4+2=6 coins. So, here, instead of using 25 +10 +7*1, which is 35 +7=42, they used 40 +2=42. So, replacing 25 +10 with 4*10. So, instead of 25 +10 (2 coins) contributing 35 cents, they used 4*10 (4 coins) contributing 40 cents. Wait, but 40 is more than 35. How does that add up? Because the total N is 42. So, 25 +10 +7*1=42, but 4*10 +2*1=42. So, the difference is that in the optimal solution, they used more dimes and fewer quarters. But why does that work?\n\nBecause by using 4 dimes (40), they only need 2 pennies, whereas using a quarter and a dime (35) requires 7 pennies. So, replacing a quarter and a dime (2 coins) with 4 dimes (4 coins) and reducing pennies by 5. So, net coins saved: 2 coins (quarters and dimes) vs. 4 coins (dimes) and 2 pennies instead of 7. So, total coins: 4 +2=6 vs. 2 +7=9. So, saved 3 coins.\n\nSo, the key here is that replacing a quarter and some dimes/pennies with more dimes and fewer pennies can result in fewer coins. So, when is this possible?\n\nIn the example, replacing 25 +10 +7*1 with 4*10 +2*1. So, effectively, replacing 25 +10 +7*1 (which is 35 +7=42) with 40 +2=42. So, replacing 35 with 40, which is 5 more, but adjusting the pennies accordingly.\n\nBut how does that make sense? Because 40 =35 +5. So, you're increasing the amount contributed by dimes by 5 cents, which allows you to reduce the pennies by 5. But pennies are 1 cent each, so reducing 5 pennies saves 5 coins, while increasing dimes by 5 cents requires adding 0.5 dimes, but since we can't split dimes, we need to add an extra dime (10 cents) and subtract 5 pennies. Wait, but in the example, they added 3 more dimes (from 1 to 4) and subtracted 5 pennies (from 7 to 2). So, net coins: +3 dimes -5 pennies, which is a net change of -2 coins. So, total coins saved: 3 -5 = -2? Wait, adding 3 dimes is +3 coins, subtracting 5 pennies is -5 coins, so total is 3 -5 = -2 coins. So, total coins saved is 2 coins? Wait, original coins were 1 quarter +1 dime +7 pennies =9 coins. New is 4 dimes +2 pennies=6 coins. So, difference is -3 coins. Wait, 9 -6=3. So, how does that breakdown?\n\nAh, replacing 1 quarter (1 coin) and 1 dime (1 coin) with 4 dimes (4 coins) and replacing 7 pennies with 2 pennies. So, coins from quarters/dimes: 1 +1=2 coins vs. 4 coins. So, that's +2 coins. But pennies: 7 vs. 2, saving 5 coins. So net saving: 5 -2=3 coins. So, total coins saved is 3. So, replacing a quarter and a dime with 3 extra dimes (total 4 dimes) and reducing pennies by 5 gives a net saving.\n\nTherefore, the key is that when you can replace a quarter and some dimes/pennies with more dimes and fewer pennies such that the number of coins saved in pennies exceeds the number of coins added in dimes, then the greedy algorithm is not optimal.\n\nSo, generalizing, suppose we have a number N where N =25*q +10*d +p, with p <10 (greedy approach). Then, if there exists some d' and p' such that 10*d' +p' =10*d +p +25*q_part (where q_part is some number of quarters replaced), and d' +p' < q_part +d +p, then the greedy algorithm is not optimal.",

Let’s say N =25*q + r, where 0 ≤ r <25.\n\nFor the remainder r, the greedy algorithm uses floor(r/10) dimes and (r%10) pennies. The number of coins for the remainder is floor(r/10) + (r%10). The minimal number of coins for r using dimes and pennies is the same as the greedy, since using as many dimes as possible minimizes the number of coins. Because dimes are worth more than pennies, so using more dimes reduces the total coins.\n\nTherefore, for the remainder r, the greedy approach is optimal. Therefore, the problem must arise when reducing the number of quarters by 1 and distributing the extra 25 cents into dimes and pennies in a way that saves coins.\n\nWait, let's formalize this:\n\nSuppose we have N =25*q + r.\n\nGreedy coins: q + floor(r/10) + (r%10).\n\nIf we use q-1 quarters instead, then we have to cover N -25*(q-1) =25 + r cents.\n\nSo, covering 25 + r cents with dimes and pennies. The minimal coins for 25 + r cents would be floor((25 + r)/10) dimes + ((25 + r)%10) pennies. So, coins needed: floor((25 + r)/10) + ((25 + r)%10).\n\nCompare this with the original coins saved by reducing quarters by 1: original coins were q + floor(r/10) + (r%10). New coins would be (q -1) + floor((25 + r)/10) + ((25 + r)%10).\n\nThe difference in coins is: [ (q -1) + floor((25 + r)/10) + ((25 + r)%10) ] - [ q + floor(r/10) + (r%10) ] = -1 + [floor((25 + r)/10) - floor(r/10)] + [ ((25 + r)%10 - (r%10)) ].\n\nSimplify:\n\nLet’s compute floor((25 + r)/10) - floor(r/10). Let’s denote r =10*a + b, where 0 ≤ b <10. Then, floor(r/10)=a, and floor((25 + r)/10)=floor(25 +10a +b)/10= floor(25 +b)/10 +a.\n\nSince 25 +b =25 +b. Since 0 ≤b <10, 25 ≤25 +b <35. So floor((25 +b)/10)=2 when 25 +b ≥20, which it always is. Specifically, floor(25 +b)/10=2 when 25 +b <30, i.e., b <5, and floor(25 +b)/10=3 when b ≥5.\n\nThus, floor((25 +r)/10) - floor(r/10)= floor((25 +b)/10) -a -a= floor((25 +b)/10) -a=2 or3 -a=Wait, no. Wait, r=10a +b, so floor(r/10)=a. Then floor((25 + r)/10)=floor(25 +10a +b)/10= floor(10a + (25 +b))/10= a + floor((25 +b)/10). So, floor((25 + r)/10) - floor(r/10)= a + floor((25 +b)/10) -a= floor((25 +b)/10).\n\nSimilarly, ((25 + r)%10 - r%10)= (25 +r -10*floor((25 +r)/10)) - (r -10*floor(r/10))=25 +r -10*floor((25 +r)/10) -r +10*floor(r/10)=25 -10*(floor((25 +r)/10) - floor(r/10)).\n\nBut since floor((25 +r)/10) - floor(r/10)=floor((25 +b)/10) as above.\n\nSo, ((25 + r)%10 - r%10)=25 -10*floor((25 +b)/10).\n\nBut let's compute ((25 + r)%10 - (r%10))=(25 +b)%10 -b. Since r%10 =b.\n\n25 +b =10*2 +5 +b. So, (25 +b)%10=(5 +b)%10. So, (5 +b) if 5 +b <10, else (5 +b -10).\n\nSo:\n\nIf b <5: (5 +b) -b=5\n\nIf b ≥5: (5 +b -10) -b=5 -10= -5\n\nTherefore, ((25 + r)%10 - r%10)=5 if b <5, else -5.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe difference in coins is:\n\n-1 + floor((25 +b)/10) + [5 if b <5 else -5]\n\nFrom above, floor((25 +b)/10)=2 if b <5 (since 25 +b <30), else 3 (since 25 +b ≥30 when b ≥5).\n\nSo:\n\nIf b <5:\n\nDifference = -1 +2 +5=6\n\nIf b ≥5:\n\nDifference= -1 +3 -5= -3\n\nTherefore, the difference in coins when reducing quarters by 1 is:\n\nIf the remainder r=10a +b, where b is the unit digit (0 ≤b <10):\n\n- If b <5: difference=6.

For each residue r, the number of N in1-1000 congruent to r mod25 is floor((1000 -r)/25) +1 if r≠0, and floor(1000/25)=40 for r=0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the number of N≡r mod25 in1-1000 for each r.\n\nFor r=0: N=25,50,...,1000. Total numbers=40.\n\nFor r=1-24: Each residue occurs floor((1000 -r)/25) +1 times.\n\nFor example, r=1: N=1,26,51,...,976. Let's compute:\n\nThe smallest N≡1 mod25 is1, then26,..., up to the largest ≤1000.\n\nThe largest N=25*k +1 ≤1000 →25*k ≤999 →k= floor(999/25)=39.96→k=39. So, N=25*39 +1=975 +1=976. So, numbers from1 to976 with step25: total numbers= (976 -1)/25 +1= (975)/25 +1=39 +1=40.\n\nSimilarly, for any r=1-24:\n\nThe numbers are r,25 +r,...,25*k +r ≤1000.\n\nThe maximum k is floor((1000 -r)/25).\n\nFor r=1: floor(999/25)=39.96→39.\n\nSo, numbers=39 +1=40.\n\nSimilarly, for r=24: N=24,49,...,999.\n\n25*k +24 ≤1000 →25*k ≤976 →k=39.04→k=39. So, N=25*39 +24=975 +24=999. Total numbers=39 +1=40.\n\nTherefore, for each residue r=0-24, there are40 numbers in1-1000 congruent to r mod25, except for r=0, which has40 numbers (25,50,...,1000), and r=1-24 also have40 numbers each. But wait, total numbers would be25 residues *40=1000. But since N starts at1, r=0 corresponds to N=25,50,...,1000 (40 numbers), and r=1-24 correspond to N=1-24,26-49,...,976-999 (each40 numbers). Total:40 +24*40=40 +960=1000. Correct.\n\nBut in our case, we are interested in residues r where r mod10 <5. There are15 such residues (r=0-4,10-14,20-24). For each of these15 residues, there are40 numbers N≡r mod25 in1-1000.\n\nBut wait, for r=0:40 numbers.\n\nFor r=1-4:40 each.\n\nFor r=10-14:40 each.\n\nFor r=20-24:40 each.\n\nTotal:1 +4 +5 +5=15 residues, each with40 numbers.
