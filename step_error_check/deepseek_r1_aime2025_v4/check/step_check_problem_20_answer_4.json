The arcs are labeled DE, EH, HJ, etc., but the problem specifically mentions DE, HJ, FG. Wait, the problem says \"the points G, D, E, H, J, and F divide the circumcircle of DEF into six minor arcs,\" so the order is G, D, E, H, J, F around the circle. So starting at G, going to D, then E, H, J, F, and back to G. Each adjacent pair forms an arc. So arcs are GD, DE, EH, HJ, JF, FG. Wait, but the problem mentions arcs DE, HJ, FG. So DE is from D to E, HJ is from H to J, and FG is from F to G. Then the other arcs are GD, EH, JF. But the problem asks for DE + 2*HJ + 3*FG. So we need to find the measures of arcs DE, HJ, FG, multiply them by 1, 2, 3 respectively, and sum them up.\n\nBut first, perhaps I need to determine the measures of these arcs. Let's recall that DEF's circumcircle has arcs DE = 72°, EF = 168°, FD = 120°, as established earlier. But now with points G, H, J added, the circle is divided into six arcs. So perhaps the arcs GD, DE, EH, HJ, JF, FG.

      "reasoning_step": "Alternatively, since DEF is the medial triangle, coordinates might help. Let me consider coordinate geometry.\n\nLet me place triangle ABC in coordinate system to simplify calculations. Let me assign coordinates to ABC such that computations are manageable.\n\nLet me let point A be at the origin (0,0). Let me assume AB is along the x-axis. Since angle BAC is 84°, angle ABC is 60°, angle ACB is 36°, and sides BC is the longest, AC is next, AB is shortest.\n\nBut perhaps using the Law of Sines on triangle ABC first. Let me compute the sides.\n\nIn triangle ABC, let sides BC = a, AC = b, AB = c.\n\nBy Law of Sines:\n\na / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C\n\nGiven angles:\n\nAngle A = 84°, angle B = 60°, angle C = 36°.\n\nSo,\n\na / sin 84° = b / sin 60° = c / sin 36°\n\nLet me compute the ratios.\n\nCompute sin 84° ≈ sin(84°) ≈ 0.9945\n\nsin 60° = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660\n\nsin 36° ≈ 0.5878\n\nSo ratios:\n\na : b : c ≈ 0.9945 : 0.8660 : 0.5878\n\nBut to make calculations easier, let's assign a value to one side. Let me let AB = c = 1. Then,\n\nFrom Law of Sines:\n\na / sin 84° = 1 / sin 36°\n\nSo a = sin 84° / sin 36° ≈ 0.9945 / 0.5878 ≈ 1.693\n\nSimilarly, b = sin 60° / sin 36° ≈ 0.8660 / 0.5878 ≈ 1.473\n\nSo sides:\n\nAB = 1\n\nAC ≈ 1.473\n\nBC ≈ 1.693\n\nBut since DEF is the medial triangle, midpoints:\n\nD is midpoint of BC: coordinates average of B and C.\n\nE is midpoint of AC: coordinates average of A and C.\n\nF is midpoint of AB: coordinates average of A and B.\n\nBut to compute coordinates, let's place triangle ABC appropriately.\n\nLet me place point A at (0,0).\n\nLet me place point B at (c, 0) = (1, 0).\n\nPoint C is somewhere in the plane. Let me compute coordinates of C.\n\nFrom Law of Cosines in triangle ABC:\n\nIn triangle ABC, angle at A is 84°, sides AB = 1, AC = b ≈ 1.473.\n\nCoordinates of C can be found using angle at A.\n\nFrom point A (0,0), AB is along x-axis to (1,0). Point C makes angle 84° at A, so coordinates of C can be (b * cos(theta), b * sin(theta)), where theta is 84°. Wait, angle BAC is 84°, so if AB is along x-axis from A(0,0) to B(1,0), then AC makes an angle of 84° with AB. Therefore, coordinates of C would be (b * cos(84°), b * sin(84°)). Since AC = b ≈ 1.473.\n\nCompute cos(84°) ≈ 0.1045\n\nsin(84°) ≈ 0.9945\n\nSo coordinates of C ≈ (1.473 * 0.1045, 1.473 * 0.9945) ≈ (0.154, 1.465)\n\nTherefore, approximate coordinates:\n\nA(0,0), B(1,0), C(0.154, 1.465)\n\nMidpoints:\n\nD is midpoint of BC: average of B(1,0) and C(0.154,1.465)\n\nD ≈ ((1 + 0.154)/2, (0 + 1.465)/2) ≈ (0.577, 0.7325)\n\nE is midpoint of AC: average of A(0,0) and C(0.154,1.465)\n\nE ≈ (0.077, 0.7325)\n\nF is midpoint of AB: average of A(0,0) and B(1,0)\n\nF ≈ (0.5, 0)\n\nNow, DEF is triangle with vertices D(0.577, 0.7325), E(0.077, 0.7325), F(0.5, 0)\n\nNow, we need to find the circumcircle of DEF. Let's compute its center and radius.\n\nFirst, find the perpendicular bisectors of DE and DF to find the center.\n\nCompute midpoint of DE: average of D(0.577, 0.7325) and E(0.077, 0.7325). Midpoint is ((0.577 + 0.077)/2, (0.7325 + 0.7325)/2) = (0.327, 0.7325)\n\nThe slope of DE: since D and E have the same y-coordinate (0.7325), DE is horizontal. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector is vertical, passing through midpoint (0.327, 0.7325). So equation is x = 0.327.\n\nNow compute midpoint of DF: average of D(0.577, 0.7325) and F(0.5, 0). Midpoint is ((0.577 + 0.5)/2, (0.7325 + 0)/2) ≈ (0.5385, 0.36625)\n\nSlope of DF: (0 - 0.7325)/(0.5 - 0.577) = (-0.7325)/(-0.077) ≈ 9.5. So slope is approximately 9.5. Therefore, perpendicular slope is -1/9.5 ≈ -0.10526.\n\nEquation of perpendicular bisector of DF: passes through midpoint (0.5385, 0.36625) with slope -0.10526.\n\nEquation: y - 0.36625 = -0.10526(x - 0.5385)\n\nFind intersection with x = 0.327 (perpendicular bisector of DE).\n\nSubstitute x = 0.327 into equation:\n\ny - 0.36625 = -0.10526*(0.327 - 0.5385) ≈ -0.10526*(-0.2115) ≈ 0.0223\n\nTherefore, y ≈ 0.36625 + 0.0223 ≈ 0.38855\n\nSo center of circumcircle of DEF is approximately (0.327, 0.38855)\n\nRadius is distance from center to D: compute distance between (0.327, 0.38855) and D(0.577, 0.7325):\n\nΔx = 0.577 - 0.327 = 0.25\n\nΔy = 0.7325 - 0.38855 ≈ 0.34395\n\nDistance squared: 0.25² + 0.34395² ≈ 0.0625 + 0.1183 ≈ 0.1808\n\nDistance ≈ sqrt(0.1808) ≈ 0.4253\n\nSimilarly, check distance to E(0.077, 0.7325):\n\nΔx = 0.077 - 0.327 = -0.25\n\nΔy = 0.7325 - 0.38855 ≈ 0.34395\n\nSame distance, sqrt(0.25² + 0.34395²) ≈ 0.4253\n\nSimilarly, distance to F(0.5, 0):\n\nΔx = 0.5 - 0.327 = 0.173\n\nΔy = 0 - 0.38855 = -0.38855\n\nDistance squared: 0.173² + (-0.38855)^2 ≈ 0.03 + 0.151 ≈ 0.181\n\nDistance ≈ 0.4253. Okay, so radius is approximately 0.4253.\n\nNow, parametrize the circumcircle of DEF. With center at (0.327, 0.38855) and radius ≈ 0.4253.\n\nNow, need to find points G, H, J where BD, AE, AF intersect the circumcircle again.\n\nFirst, let's find equations of lines BD, AE, AF.\n\nPoint B is at (1,0), D is at (0.577, 0.7325). So line BD.\n\nSlope of BD: (0.7325 - 0)/(0.577 - 1) = 0.7325 / (-0.423) ≈ -1.73\n\nEquation of BD: using point B(1,0):\n\ny - 0 = -1.73(x - 1)\n\ny = -1.73x + 1.73\n\nWe need to find intersection G of this line with the circumcircle of DEF, other than D.\n\nSimilarly, line AE: points A(0,0) and E(0.077, 0.7325). Slope is (0.7325 - 0)/(0.077 - 0) ≈ 0.7325 / 0.077 ≈ 9.5\n\nEquation: y = 9.5x\n\nIntersection H with circumcircle other than E.\n\nLine AF: points A(0,0) and F(0.5,0). This is horizontal line y = 0. Wait, AF is from A(0,0) to F(0.5,0), so it's along the x-axis. Therefore, line AF is y = 0. Intersection J with circumcircle other than F.\n\nSo point J is the other intersection of line AF (y=0) with the circumcircle of DEF. Since F is (0.5,0), which is on the circle, the other intersection is J.\n\nSimilarly, G is other intersection of BD with the circle, H is other intersection of AE with the circle.\n\nLet's compute coordinates of G, H, J.\n\nFirst, find G: intersection of BD (y = -1.73x + 1.73) with circumcircle.\n\nCircumcircle equation: (x - 0.327)^2 + (y - 0.38855)^2 ≈ (0.4253)^2 ≈ 0.1808\n\nSubstitute y = -1.73x + 1.73 into the circle equation:\n\n(x - 0.327)^2 + (-1.73x + 1.73 - 0.38855)^2 ≈ 0.1808\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (x - 0.327)^2\n\nSecond term: (-1.73x + 1.34145)^2\n\nExpand both:\n\nFirst term: x² - 0.654x + 0.1069\n\nSecond term: ( -1.73x + 1.34145 )² ≈ (1.73x)^2 - 2*1.73x*1.34145 + (1.34145)^2 ≈ 2.9929x² - 4.646x + 1.799\n\nSum of terms:\n\nx² - 0.654x + 0.1069 + 2.9929x² - 4.646x + 1.799 ≈ 3.9929x² - 5.3x + 1.9059\n\nSet equal to 0.1808:\n\n3.9929x² - 5.3x + 1.9059 - 0.1808 ≈ 3.9929x² - 5.3x + 1.7251 = 0\n\nMultiply through by 10000 to eliminate decimals:\n\nApproximately, 39929x² - 53000x + 17251 = 0\n\nUse quadratic formula:\n\nx = [53000 ± sqrt(53000² - 4*39929*17251)] / (2*39929)\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n53000² = 2,809,000,000\n\n4*39929*17251 ≈ 4*39929*17251 ≈ Let's approximate:\n\n39929 ≈ 40,000, 17251 ≈ 17,000\n\nSo 4*40,000*17,000 = 4*680,000,000 = 2,720,000,000\n\nThus discriminant ≈ 2,809,000,000 - 2,720,000,000 = 89,000,000\n\nsqrt(89,000,000) ≈ 9434\n\nSo x ≈ [53000 ± 9434] / 79858\n\nCompute two solutions:\n\nx1 ≈ (53000 + 9434)/79858 ≈ 62434 / 79858 ≈ 0.782\n\nx2 ≈ (53000 - 9434)/79858 ≈ 43566 / 79858 ≈ 0.5456",

So G is between B and D.\n\nSimilarly for H and J.\n\nBut let's proceed with coordinates.\n\nFor x ≈ 0.5456, compute y = -1.73x + 1.73 ≈ -1.73*0.5456 + 1.73 ≈ -0.945 + 1.73 ≈ 0.785\n\nSo G ≈ (0.5456, 0.785)\n\nSimilarly, compute H: intersection of AE (y = 9.5x) with circumcircle.\n\nSubstitute y = 9.5x into circle equation:\n\n(x - 0.327)^2 + (9.5x - 0.38855)^2 ≈ 0.1808\n\nExpand:\n\n(x² - 0.654x + 0.1069) + (90.25x² - 7.38245x + 0.1509) ≈ 0.1808\n\nTotal: 91.25x² - 8.03645x + 0.2578 ≈ 0.1808\n\n91.25x² - 8.03645x + 0.077 ≈ 0\n\nMultiply by 10000: 912500x² - 80364.5x + 770 ≈ 0\n\nUse quadratic formula:\n\nx = [80364.5 ± sqrt(80364.5² - 4*912500*770)] / (2*912500)\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n80364.5² ≈ 6.456e9\n\n4*912500*770 ≈ 4*912500*770 ≈ 4*703, 625,000 ≈ 2.814e9\n\nDiscriminant ≈ 6.456e9 - 2.814e9 ≈ 3.642e9\n\nsqrt(3.642e9) ≈ 60,349\n\nThus,\n\nx ≈ [80364.5 ± 60349] / 1,825,000\n\nTwo solutions:\n\nx1 ≈ (80364.5 + 60349)/1,825,000 ≈ 140,713.5 / 1,825,000 ≈ 0.077 (matches point E)\n\nx2 ≈ (80364.5 - 60349)/1,825,000 ≈ 20,015.5 / 1,825,000 ≈ 0.01096\n\nSo H is at x ≈ 0.01096, y ≈ 9.5*0.01096 ≈ 0.104\n\nSo H ≈ (0.011, 0.104)\n\nSimilarly, compute J: intersection of AF (y=0) with circumcircle.\n\nSubstitute y=0 into circle equation:\n\n(x - 0.327)^2 + (0 - 0.38855)^2 ≈ 0.1808\n\nCompute:\n\n(x - 0.327)^2 + 0.151 ≈ 0.1808\n\n(x - 0.327)^2 ≈ 0.0298\n\nTake square root:\n\nx - 0.327 ≈ ±0.1726\n\nThus, x ≈ 0.327 + 0.1726 ≈ 0.4996 or x ≈ 0.327 - 0.1726 ≈ 0.1544\n\nBut AF is from A(0,0) to F(0.5,0). So AF is along x-axis from (0,0) to (0.5,0). The other intersection J is at x ≈ 0.4996 ≈ 0.5, which is F. The other solution x ≈ 0.1544 is J.\n\nWait, but AF is from A(0,0) to F(0.5,0). The line AF is the x-axis from 0 to 0.5. The circumcircle intersects AF at F(0.5,0) and J. The other intersection is at x ≈ 0.1544, which is between A and F. So J is at (0.1544, 0). But midpoint F is at (0.5,0). So J is between A and F.\n\nBut in the problem statement, points G, D, E, H, J, F are on the circle. So ordering around the circle: G, D, E, H, J, F.\n\nBut based on coordinates:\n\nG ≈ (0.5456, 0.785)\n\nD ≈ (0.577, 0.7325)\n\nE ≈ (0.077, 0.7325)\n\nH ≈ (0.011, 0.104)\n\nJ ≈ (0.1544, 0)\n\nF ≈ (0.5, 0)\n\nTo determine the order around the circle, need to compute angles of these points with respect to the center (0.327, 0.38855).\n\nCompute angles for each point:\n\nFor point G (0.5456, 0.785):\n\nVector from center: (0.5456 - 0.327, 0.785 - 0.38855) ≈ (0.2186, 0.39645)\n\nAngle: arctan(0.39645 / 0.2186) ≈ arctan(1.813) ≈ 61°\n\nFor point D (0.577, 0.7325):\n\nVector: (0.577 - 0.327, 0.7325 - 0.38855) ≈ (0.25, 0.34395)\n\nAngle: arctan(0.34395 / 0.25) ≈ arctan(1.3758) ≈ 54°. Wait, but since both x and y are positive, angle is in first quadrant. Wait, arctan(1.3758) is approximately 54°, but earlier G was at 61°, so D is at 54°, which is less than G's angle.

Therefore, the arcs subtended by the sides of DEF would be twice the angles of DEF, which are equal to the angles of ABC.\n\nWait, DEF has angles equal to ABC: 84°, 60°, 36°. Therefore, the central angles over arcs DE, EF, FD would be 168°, 120°, 72°, summing to 360°. Therefore, arc DE is 168°, arc EF is 120°, arc FD is 72°. Wait, this contradicts earlier calculation.\n\nWait, confusion arises between inscribed angles and central angles.\n\nIn the circumcircle of DEF, angle at D is half the arc EF. Since angle at D is 84°, arc EF is 168°. Similarly, angle at E is 60°, so arc DF is 120°, and angle at F is 36°, so arc DE is 72°. Therefore, the central angles over arcs DE, EF, FD are 72°, 168°, 120°, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the original arcs between D, E, F are DE = 72°, EF = 168°, FD = 120°.\n\nNow, points G, H, J are midpoints of medians BD, AE, AF. These points are also on the nine-point circle. Therefore, the arcs between these points can be determined based on their positions.\n\nSince G is the midpoint of BD, and D is midpoint of BC, then G is the midpoint of the median BD. Similarly, H is midpoint of AE, J is midpoint of AF.\n\nIn the nine-point circle, the midpoints of the medians are also on the circle.
