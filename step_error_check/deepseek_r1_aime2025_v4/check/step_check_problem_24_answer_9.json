      "reasoning_step": "First, let's recall that sin(θ) = 0 when θ is an integer multiple of π. So, the equation sin(7π·sin(5x)) = 0 implies that 7π·sin(5x) = kπ for some integer k. Simplifying that, we can divide both sides by π to get 7·sin(5x) = k. Therefore, sin(5x) = k/7. But since the sine function only takes values between -1 and 1, k/7 must also lie in that interval. Therefore, k must be an integer such that -7 ≤ k ≤ 7. However, since sin(5x) can be exactly -1 or 1, k can be from -7 to 7 inclusive. So k ∈ {-7, -6, ..., 0, ..., 6, 7}. That gives us 15 possible integer values for k.\n\nBut wait, let's check: if k = -7, then sin(5x) = -1; if k = 7, sin(5x) = 1. So those extremes are possible. So, for each integer k from -7 to 7, sin(5x) = k/7. Each of these equations will have solutions for x in the interval 0 < x < 2π.\n\nNow, let's think about solving sin(5x) = c, where c = k/7. For each c between -1 and 1, the general solution for x is:\n\n5x = arcsin(c) + 2πn or 5x = π - arcsin(c) + 2πn, where n is an integer.\n\nTherefore, solving for x:\n\nx = [arcsin(c) + 2πn]/5 or x = [π - arcsin(c) + 2πn]/5.\n\nWe need to find all such x in the interval 0 < x < 2π.\n\nSince x is between 0 and 2π, let's see how many solutions each equation sin(5x) = c has in this interval.\n\nFirst, note that 5x will range from 0 to 10π as x goes from 0 to 2π. Therefore, the function sin(5x) completes 5 full periods over [0, 2π]. In each period of sin(θ), which is 2π, there are two solutions to sin(θ) = c (except when c = ±1, in which case there is one solution per period). Therefore, over 5 periods, we would expect 2 solutions per period for most c, but 1 solution per period when c = ±1.\n\nBut in our case, c = k/7, so c can be -1, -6/7, ..., 0, ..., 6/7, 1. So, for c = ±1, each equation sin(5x) = ±1 will have 5 solutions in [0, 2π), since each period contributes one solution. For other values of c (i.e., k ≠ ±7), each equation sin(5x) = c will have 10 solutions in [0, 2π), since each period contributes two solutions.",

For k=±7, sin(5x)=±1 has 5 solutions each. Therefore, total number of solutions is 15 values of k: 13*10 + 2*5=130 +10=140. So n=140.\n\nBut let me verify with k=0. For k=0, sin(5x)=0. Solutions at x=πn/5, n=1 to 10 (since x must be between 0 and 2π). So 10 solutions. Correct. So that's 10 solutions for k=0.\n\nSimilarly, for k=1, sin(5x)=1/7. Each period of sin(5x) will have two solutions, so over 5 periods, 10 solutions. Same for k=-1, sin(5x)=-1/7. So yes, each non-extreme k gives 10 solutions.\n\nTherefore, total zeros n=140.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"values of x\" in the interval 0 < x < 2π. So we need to check if any solutions overlap for different k. But since sin(5x)=k1/7 and sin(5x)=k2/7 can't have overlapping solutions unless k1=k2. So each solution x corresponds to exactly one k. Therefore, total solutions n=140.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Wait, but sin(5x)=k/7. For different k's, could x satisfy multiple equations? For example, suppose there exists x where sin(5x)=1/7 and sin(5x)=2/7? But that would require 1/7=2/7, which is impossible. Therefore, each solution x corresponds to exactly one k. Therefore, total number of zeros is indeed 15 k-values multiplied by their respective solutions: 13*10 + 2*5=140. So n=140.\n\nNow, the second part: t is the number of these zeros where the graph is tangent to the x-axis. That happens when f(x)=0 and f'(x)=0. So we need to find the points where both sin(7π·sin(5x))=0 and the derivative d/dx [sin(7π·sin(5x))]=0.\n\nSo first, let's recall that f(x)=sin(7π·sin(5x)). Then f'(x)=cos(7π·sin(5x)) * 7π*cos(5x)*5.\n\nSo f'(x)=35π·cos(5x)·cos(7π·sin(5x)).\n\nAt points where f(x)=0, sin(7π·sin(5x))=0, which implies that 7π·sin(5x)=mπ for some integer m, so sin(5x)=m/7. So as before, m must be integer between -7 and 7.\n\nBut at these points, the derivative f'(x)=35π·cos(5x)·cos(mπ). Because 7π·sin(5x)=mπ, so sin(5x)=m/7, so cos(7π·sin(5x))=cos(mπ)=(-1)^m.\n\nTherefore, f'(x)=35π·cos(5x)·(-1)^m.\n\nFor the derivative to be zero, either cos(5x)=0 or (-1)^m=0. But (-1)^m is never zero, so the derivative is zero only if cos(5x)=0.\n\nTherefore, at a zero of f(x), the graph is tangent to the x-axis if and only if cos(5x)=0.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the zeros of f(x) where cos(5x)=0. So we need to solve sin(5x)=m/7 and cos(5x)=0 simultaneously.\n\nBut cos(5x)=0 implies that 5x=π/2 + πn, so x=π/10 + πn/5. Then sin(5x)=sin(π/2 + πn)=sin(π/2 + πn). But sin(π/2 + πn)=sin(π/2)cos(πn) + cos(π/2)sin(πn)=cos(πn). Since cos(πn)=(-1)^n. Therefore, sin(5x)=(-1)^n.\n\nBut sin(5x)=m/7. Therefore, (-1)^n=m/7. Since m is integer between -7 and 7, m/7 must be ±1. Therefore, m=±7. Therefore, sin(5x)=±1. Therefore, the points where cos(5x)=0 and sin(5x)=±1 correspond to m=±7. Therefore, these are exactly the zeros where sin(5x)=±1, i.e., k=±7.\n\nTherefore, the tangent points occur only at the zeros corresponding to k=±7. Each of these cases (k=7 and k=-7) gives sin(5x)=1 and sin(5x)=-1, which each have 5 solutions in (0,2π). However, we need to check if at those solutions, cos(5x)=0.\n\nWait, but earlier we saw that when sin(5x)=±1, then cos(5x)=0. Because sin^2θ + cos^2θ=1. So if sinθ=±1, then cosθ=0. Therefore, indeed, at all points where sin(5x)=±1, cos(5x)=0. Therefore, all zeros corresponding to k=±7 (i.e., m=±7) will have f'(x)=0. Therefore, these are the points where the graph is tangent to the x-axis.\n\nTherefore, the number t is equal to the number of zeros corresponding to k=±7, which is 5 +5=10. Therefore, t=10.",

So total n=140. Correct.\n\nThen t is the number of those zeros where the graph is tangent to the x-axis. Tangent occurs where both f(x)=0 and f'(x)=0. As established, these occur precisely at the zeros where sin(5x)=±1, which correspond to k=±7, each contributing 5 solutions. Therefore, 5+5=10. So t=10. Therefore, n+t=140+10=150.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 150.\n\nBut let me check if there's any possibility that other zeros might have f'(x)=0. Suppose for some k ≠ ±7, there exists x where sin(5x)=k/7 and cos(5x)=0. But if cos(5x)=0, then sin(5x)=±1, which would require k/7=±1, i.e., k=±7. Therefore, no other k's can satisfy both sin(5x)=k/7 and cos(5x)=0. Therefore, t=10 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 150.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{150}\n",
