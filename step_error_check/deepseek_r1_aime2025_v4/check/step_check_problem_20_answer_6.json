Wait, DEF has sides parallel to AB, BC, AC? Wait, DE is parallel to AB, EF is parallel to BC, FD is parallel to AC. Therefore, angles in DEF correspond to angles in ABC but maybe rotated or something. Wait, angle at D in DEF: since DE is parallel to AB and DF is parallel to AC, then angle at D is equal to angle BAC? Wait, because DE is parallel to AB and DF is parallel to AC, so the angle between DE and DF at D would be the same as the angle between AB and AC at A, which is angle BAC = 84 degrees. Similarly, angle at E would be equal to angle ABC = 60 degrees, and angle at F would be equal to angle ACB = 36 degrees. Therefore, triangle DEF has angles 84°, 60°, 36°, same as ABC. Wait, but DEF is the medial triangle, so it's similar to ABC but scaled by 1/2. Wait, but angles remain the same. So DEF is similar to ABC with a ratio of 1:2. Therefore, angles in DEF are equal to angles in ABC, which are 84°, 60°, 36°. Therefore, the circumcircle of DEF has triangle DEF inscribed in it with those angles.\n\nBut wait, DEF is similar to ABC but scaled down. Therefore, the circumradius of DEF would be half the circumradius of ABC. But maybe we don't need the actual circumradius, but the arc measures. Since in the circumcircle of DEF, the arcs DE, HJ, FG correspond to certain central angles.\n\nWait, arc DE is the arc between D and E on the circumcircle of DEF. Since DEF is a triangle inscribed in its circumcircle, the arc DE would correspond to twice the angle at F in triangle DEF. Because in a circle, the central angle over an arc is twice the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc. So angle at F is 36°, so arc DE would be 72°. Similarly, arc EF would be 2* angle at D = 2*84°=168°, and arc FD would be 2* angle at E = 2*60°=120°. Wait, but DEF's angles are 84°, 60°, 36°, so arcs opposite those angles would be 2* those angles. Wait, no. Wait, in any triangle inscribed in a circle, the central angle over an arc is twice the opposite angle. Wait, if we have triangle DEF inscribed in a circle, then the arc DE is opposite angle F, so the central angle for arc DE is 2* angle F = 2*36°=72°, so arc DE is 72°. Similarly, arc EF would be 2* angle D = 2*84°=168°, and arc FD is 2* angle E = 2*60°=120°. Wait, but adding up 72+168+120=360°, which is correct. So arcs DE=72°, EF=168°, FD=120°.

      "reasoning_step": "Alternatively, maybe using complex numbers. Assign coordinates to ABC, compute DEF, compute the circumcircle, find intersections G, H, J, then compute the arcs.\n\nLet me try coordinate geometry. Let's place triangle ABC in coordinate plane in a convenient way.\n\nLet me set vertex B at the origin (0,0). Let me let BC lie along the x-axis. Let me denote BC as side a, AC as side b, AB as side c. But maybe assigning coordinates based on angles.\n\nGiven angles at A, B, C: 84°, 60°, 36°. Let me denote vertex B at (0,0), vertex C at (c,0), vertex A somewhere in the plane. Then angle at B is 60°, angle at C is 36°, angle at A is 84°. Let's use the Law of Sines to find side lengths.\n\nLaw of Sines: In triangle ABC, a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C.\n\nWait, sides opposite angles: side a is BC, opposite angle A (84°); side b is AC, opposite angle B (60°); side c is AB, opposite angle C (36°).\n\nSo, a / sin 84° = b / sin 60° = c / sin 36°.\n\nLet me compute the ratios. Let me denote the circumradius of ABC as R. Then a = 2R sin A, etc. But maybe instead, assign a specific length for simplicity.\n\nLet me assume that the circumradius of ABC is 1 for simplicity. Then:\n\na = BC = 2R sin A = 2*1*sin 84° ≈ 2*0.9945 ≈ 1.989\n\nb = AC = 2R sin B = 2*1*sin 60° ≈ 2*(√3/2) ≈ 1.732\n\nc = AB = 2R sin C = 2*1*sin 36° ≈ 2*0.5878 ≈ 1.1756\n\nBut maybe instead of assuming R=1, let's assign BC to be of length 1. Then using Law of Sines:\n\na = BC = 1 = 2R sin 84° ⇒ R = 1 / (2 sin 84°)\n\nThen other sides:\n\nb = AC = 2R sin 60° = (1 / sin 84°) * sin 60° ≈ (1 / 0.9945) * 0.8660 ≈ 0.8707\n\nc = AB = 2R sin 36° = (1 / sin 84°) * sin 36° ≈ (1 / 0.9945) * 0.5878 ≈ 0.591\n\nBut maybe working with actual coordinates would be messy with these lengths. Alternatively, let's assign coordinates more cleverly.\n\nLet me place point B at (0,0), point C at (1,0). Then we need to find coordinates of point A such that angle at B is 60°, angle at C is 36°, and angle at A is 84°. Let's compute coordinates of A.\n\nUsing Law of Sines:\n\nBC / sin A = AB / sin C = AC / sin B\n\nGiven BC = 1, angle A = 84°, angle B = 60°, angle C = 36°.\n\nThus:\n\nAB = (BC * sin C) / sin A = (1 * sin 36°) / sin 84° ≈ (0.5878) / 0.9945 ≈ 0.591\n\nAC = (BC * sin B) / sin A = (1 * sin 60°) / sin 84° ≈ (0.8660) / 0.9945 ≈ 0.8707\n\nSo coordinates of A can be found using these distances. Let me compute coordinates.\n\nSince point B is at (0,0), point C is at (1,0). Let me place point A somewhere in the plane. Let me denote coordinates of A as (x,y). Then distance AB = sqrt(x² + y²) ≈ 0.591, distance AC = sqrt((x - 1)² + y²) ≈ 0.8707.\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\nx² + y² ≈ (0.591)² ≈ 0.349\n\n(x - 1)² + y² ≈ (0.8707)² ≈ 0.758\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n(x - 1)² + y² - x² - y² ≈ 0.758 - 0.349 ⇒ (x² - 2x + 1) - x² ≈ 0.409 ⇒ -2x + 1 ≈ 0.409 ⇒ -2x ≈ -0.591 ⇒ x ≈ 0.2955\n\nThen plugging back into x² + y² ≈ 0.349:\n\n(0.2955)^2 + y² ≈ 0.349 ⇒ 0.0873 + y² ≈ 0.349 ⇒ y² ≈ 0.2617 ⇒ y ≈ 0.5116\n\nSo coordinates of A are approximately (0.2955, 0.5116). Let me verify angles.\n\nUsing coordinates, angle at B (0,0) between BA and BC. Vector BA is (0.2955, 0.5116), vector BC is (1,0). The angle between BA and BC can be calculated using dot product:\n\ncos(theta) = (BA . BC) / (|BA| |BC|) = (0.2955 * 1 + 0.5116 * 0) / (0.591 * 1) ≈ 0.2955 / 0.591 ≈ 0.500 ⇒ theta ≈ 60°, which matches. Similarly, angle at C can be computed.\n\nVector CB is (-1,0), vector CA is (0.2955 - 1, 0.5116 - 0) = (-0.7045, 0.5116). The angle at C is between vectors CB and CA.\n\nDot product: (-1)(-0.7045) + 0*0.5116 = 0.7045. |CB| = 1, |CA| ≈ 0.8707.\n\ncos(theta) = 0.7045 / (1 * 0.8707) ≈ 0.7045 / 0.8707 ≈ 0.809, so theta ≈ 36°, which matches. Good.\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nB: (0,0)\n\nC: (1,0)\n\nA: approximately (0.2955, 0.5116)\n\nNow, midpoints D, E, F.\n\nD is midpoint of BC: ((0+1)/2, (0+0)/2) = (0.5, 0)\n\nE is midpoint of AC: ((0.2955 + 1)/2, (0.5116 + 0)/2) ≈ (0.64775, 0.2558)\n\nF is midpoint of AB: ((0 + 0.2955)/2, (0 + 0.5116)/2) ≈ (0.14775, 0.2558)\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nD: (0.5, 0)\n\nE: ≈ (0.64775, 0.2558)\n\nF: ≈ (0.14775, 0.2558)\n\nNow, DEF is the medial triangle with vertices at D, E, F.

      "reasoning_step": "First, find the circumcircle equation passing through D(0.5,0), E(0.64775,0.2558), F(0.14775,0.2558).\n\nTo find the circumcircle, we can find the perpendicular bisectors of DE and DF and find their intersection.\n\nFirst, compute midpoint of DE: midpoint between D(0.5,0) and E(0.64775,0.2558):\n\nx: (0.5 + 0.64775)/2 ≈ 1.14775/2 ≈ 0.573875\n\ny: (0 + 0.2558)/2 ≈ 0.1279\n\nSlope of DE: (0.2558 - 0)/(0.64775 - 0.5) ≈ 0.2558 / 0.14775 ≈ 1.730\n\nSo slope of DE is approximately 1.730, so the perpendicular bisector will have slope -1/1.730 ≈ -0.578.\n\nEquation of perpendicular bisector of DE: passes through midpoint (0.573875, 0.1279) with slope -0.578.\n\nSimilarly, compute midpoint of DF: midpoint between D(0.5,0) and F(0.14775,0.2558):\n\nx: (0.5 + 0.14775)/2 ≈ 0.64775/2 ≈ 0.323875\n\ny: (0 + 0.2558)/2 ≈ 0.1279\n\nSlope of DF: (0.2558 - 0)/(0.14775 - 0.5) ≈ 0.2558 / (-0.35225) ≈ -0.726\n\nSo slope of DF is approximately -0.726, so perpendicular bisector slope is reciprocal and opposite: 1/0.726 ≈ 1.377.\n\nEquation of perpendicular bisector of DF: passes through midpoint (0.323875, 0.1279) with slope ≈1.377.\n\nNow, find intersection of these two perpendicular bisectors to get the circumcircle center.\n\nFirst, write equations:\n\nFor DE's bisector: y - 0.1279 = -0.578(x - 0.573875)\n\nFor DF's bisector: y - 0.1279 = 1.377(x - 0.323875)\n\nSet them equal:\n\n-0.578(x - 0.573875) + 0.1279 = 1.377(x - 0.323875) + 0.1279\n\nSubtract 0.1279 from both sides:\n\n-0.578(x - 0.573875) = 1.377(x - 0.323875)\n\nMultiply out:\n\n-0.578x + 0.578*0.573875 ≈ -0.578x + 0.3317 = 1.377x - 1.377*0.323875 ≈ 1.377x - 0.4463\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-0.578x + 0.3317 -1.377x + 0.4463 = 0 ⇒ (-0.578 -1.377)x + (0.3317 +0.4463) ≈ (-1.955)x + 0.778 = 0\n\nThus, x ≈ 0.778 / 1.955 ≈ 0.398\n\nThen plug x ≈0.398 into DE's bisector equation:\n\ny ≈ -0.578*(0.398 -0.573875) +0.1279 ≈ -0.578*(-0.175875) +0.1279 ≈ 0.1017 +0.1279 ≈ 0.2296\n\nSo circumcircle center is approximately (0.398, 0.2296). Let's verify the distance to D, E, F.\n\nDistance to D(0.5,0):\n\nsqrt((0.5 -0.398)^2 + (0 -0.2296)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.0104 + 0.0527) ≈ sqrt(0.0631) ≈0.2512\n\nDistance to E(0.64775,0.2558):\n\nsqrt((0.64775 -0.398)^2 + (0.2558 -0.2296)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.0623 + 0.0007) ≈ sqrt(0.063) ≈0.251\n\nDistance to F(0.14775,0.2558):\n\nsqrt((0.14775 -0.398)^2 + (0.2558 -0.2296)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.0627 +0.0007) ≈ sqrt(0.0634)≈0.2518\n\nSo approximately equal radii (~0.251), which is consistent. So the circumradius is approximately 0.251 units in this coordinate system.\n\nNow, need to find points G, H, J where BD, AE, AF intersect the circumcircle of DEF again.\n\nFirst, BD is the median from B(0,0) to D(0.5,0). Wait, BD is the line from (0,0) to (0.5,0), which is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (0.5,0). But D is already on the circumcircle of DEF, so the other intersection point G is another point on BD and the circumcircle. But BD is the x-axis from (0,0) to (0.5,0). The circumcircle of DEF has center at approximately (0.398,0.2296) and radius ~0.251. So BD is the x-axis from (0,0) to (0.5,0). Let's parametrize BD: points on BD are (t,0) where t ranges from 0 to 0.5. We need to find another intersection point G of BD with the circumcircle, apart from D(0.5,0).\n\nSo substitute y=0 into the circumcircle equation. The circumcircle equation is (x -0.398)^2 + (y -0.2296)^2 ≈ (0.251)^2 ≈0.063.\n\nSetting y=0:\n\n(x -0.398)^2 + (0 -0.2296)^2 ≈0.063 ⇒ (x -0.398)^2 +0.0527 ≈0.063 ⇒ (x -0.398)^2 ≈0.0103 ⇒ x -0.398 ≈±0.1015 ⇒ x≈0.398±0.1015 ⇒ x≈0.4995 or x≈0.2965\n\nBut BD is from (0,0) to (0.5,0). So x ranges from 0 to 0.5. The solutions are x≈0.4995 (~0.5) and x≈0.2965. Since D is at (0.5,0), the other intersection point G is at approximately (0.2965,0).\n\nTherefore, G is at approximately (0.2965,0).\n\nSimilarly, find H on AE and J on AF.\n\nFirst, AE: median from A(0.2955,0.5116) to E(0.64775,0.2558). Let's parametrize AE.\n\nParametric equations: from A to E. Let parameter t go from 0 to 1.\n\nx(t) = 0.2955 + t*(0.64775 -0.2955) ≈0.2955 + t*0.35225\n\ny(t) =0.5116 + t*(0.2558 -0.5116) ≈0.5116 - t*0.2558\n\nWe need to find intersection H of AE with circumcircle of DEF, other than E.\n\nE is at t=1: (0.64775,0.2558). So H is another intersection point. Let's substitute x(t), y(t) into the circumcircle equation:\n\n(x -0.398)^2 + (y -0.2296)^2 ≈0.063\n\nSubstitute:\n\n(0.2955 +0.35225t -0.398)^2 + (0.5116 -0.2558t -0.2296)^2 ≈0.063\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-0.1025 +0.35225t)^2 + (0.282 -0.2558t)^2 ≈0.063\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (-0.1025 +0.35225t)^2 ≈ (0.35225t -0.1025)^2 ≈ (0.35225t)^2 -2*0.35225t*0.1025 +0.1025² ≈0.124t² -0.0723t +0.0105\n\nSecond term: (0.282 -0.2558t)^2 ≈ (-0.2558t +0.282)^2 ≈ (0.2558t)^2 -2*0.2558t*0.282 +0.282² ≈0.0654t² -0.1435t +0.0795\n\nSumming both terms:\n\n0.124t² -0.0723t +0.0105 +0.0654t² -0.1435t +0.0795 ≈ (0.124+0.0654)t² + (-0.0723 -0.1435)t + (0.0105 +0.0795) ≈0.1894t² -0.2158t +0.09\n\nSet equal to 0.063:\n\n0.1894t² -0.2158t +0.09 =0.063 ⇒0.1894t² -0.2158t +0.027=0\n\nSolve quadratic equation:\n\nt = [0.2158 ± sqrt(0.2158² -4*0.1894*0.027)] / (2*0.1894)\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n0.2158² ≈0.0466\n\n4*0.1894*0.027≈0.0204\n\nDiscriminant ≈0.0466 -0.0204≈0.0262\n\nsqrt(0.0262)≈0.1618\n\nThus,\n\nt≈[0.2158 ±0.1618]/0.3788\n\nFirst solution: (0.2158 +0.1618)/0.3788≈0.3776/0.3788≈0.996 ≈1.0\n\nSecond solution: (0.2158 -0.1618)/0.3788≈0.054/0.3788≈0.1426\n\nSo t≈1.0 corresponds to point E, so the other intersection H is at t≈0.1426.\n\nThus, coordinates of H:\n\nx≈0.2955 +0.35225*0.1426≈0.2955 +0.0502≈0.3457\n\ny≈0.5116 -0.2558*0.1426≈0.5116 -0.0365≈0.4751\n\nSo H is approximately (0.3457,0.4751)\n\nSimilarly, find J on AF. AF is the median from A(0.2955,0.5116) to F(0.14775,0.2558). Parametrize AF:\n\nx(t) =0.2955 + t*(0.14775 -0.2955)=0.2955 -0.14775t\n\ny(t)=0.5116 + t*(0.2558 -0.5116)=0.5116 -0.2558t\n\nFind intersection J with circumcircle of DEF other than F.\n\nF is at t=1: (0.14775,0.2558).

However, since DEF's angles are known, and arcs DE, EF, FD are 72°,168°,120°, but with points G,H,J inserted, dividing those arcs into smaller ones.\n\nWait, arc DE is72°, which is between D and E. Then arc EH is96°, HJ is24.5°, JF is47.5°, FG is72°, GD is48°, and so on. But perhaps there's a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, since G is on BD, which is a median, and DEF is the medial triangle, maybe BG is equal to GD? Wait, BD is a median of ABC, D is midpoint of BC. In DEF's circumcircle, D is a point on the circle. G is another intersection point. If BD is a median, and DEF is the medial triangle, then perhaps BG * GD = power of B with respect to the circle.\n\nPower of point B with respect to DEF's circumcircle: |BT|² - r², where BT is distance from B to center T.\n\nBut maybe compute it as BG * BD = power of B.\n\nGiven center at (0.398,0.2296), distance from B(0,0) to center:\n\nsqrt(0.398² +0.2296²)≈sqrt(0.1584 +0.0527)≈sqrt(0.2111)≈0.4595\n\nPower of B: (0.4595)² - (0.251)²≈0.211 -0.063≈0.148\n\nBut BG * BD = BG * 0.5 (since BD is length 0.5 in our coordinate system where BC=1). So BG *0.5≈0.148 ⇒ BG≈0.296. Which matches our coordinate calculation where G is at (0.2965,0), so BG≈0.2965, which is≈0.296. So this checks out.\n\nSimilarly, power of point A with respect to the circle: AH * AE = AJ * AF.\n\nBut this might not directly help with arc measures.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps noting that arcs FG and GD are related. In the coordinate calculation, FG was72°, but according to the problem statement, the arcs are DE, HJ, FG. Wait, DE is72°, HJ is24.5°, FG is72°, sum is72 +2*24.5 +3*72=72 +49 +216=337°, but this is likely incorrect due to coordinate approximation.",

So the arc measures are preserved? Because angles subtended by the same chord in different circles depend on the radius, but arc length is proportional to radius. However, central angles are independent of radius. Wait, no. The central angle is the same regardless of radius, but the arc length is proportional to radius. However, in this case, DEF is similar to ABC scaled by 1/2, but rotated 180°, so the angles remain the same. Therefore, the central angles over corresponding arcs would be the same.

This is a guess-answer error (GA) / unsupported conclusion.\",\n    \"Method_Consistency\": false,\n    \"Step_Relation\": [\n        {\n            \"Parent_Step\": \"Step 18\",\n            \"Relation\": \"Review\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"Parent_Step\": \"Step 10\",\n            \"Relation\": \"Corrective\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"Parent_Step\": \"Step 89\",\n            \"Relation\": \"Corrective\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"Summary\": \"Guess final answer = 360° replacing prior work\"\n}\n</output>"
