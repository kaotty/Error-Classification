It's internally tangent to ω₂ at point B. ω₂ has radius 15, so it's larger. The centers of the circles must lie along the line connecting their centers since they're tangent. Since ω₁ is internally tangent to ω₂ at B, point B is on both circles, and the line AB is the line connecting their centers. The radius of ω₂ is 15, so the distance between the centers of ω₁ and ω₂ must be 15 - 6 = 9 units. Wait, no, hold on. If ω₁ is inside ω₂ and tangent at B, then the distance between centers A and the center of ω₂ (let's call it O) should be equal to the difference in radii because internal tangent. So, OA = 15 - 6 = 9. But point B is the point of tangency, so OB is the radius of ω₂, which is 15, and AB is the radius of ω₁, which is 6. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.",

Also, point B is the point where they touch, so B lies on OA. So OB = 15, AB = 6? Wait, no. If OA is 9, then OB (distance from O to B) should be equal to the radius of ω₂, which is 15. But OA is 9, so AB must be OA - OB? Wait, maybe I confused the centers.\n\nWait, perhaps ω₂ is centered at point B? Wait, no. The problem says ω₁ is centered at A and is internally tangent at B to ω₂. So ω₂ must be centered at some point, let's say O, such that the distance OA is 15 - 6 = 9, and the point B is on both circles. Therefore, OB = 15 (since B is on ω₂) and AB = 6 (since B is on ω₁).

The center of ω₂, let's call it O, must be along the line connecting A and B. Since they are tangent internally, the distance between centers OA is equal to the difference of radii. So OA = 15 - 6 = 9. Therefore, O is 9 units away from A towards the direction of B. Also, since B is the point of tangency, B lies on OA, and OB = 15 (radius of ω₂), AB = 6 (radius of ω₁). Therefore, OA = OB - AB => 9 = 15 - 6, which checks out. So O is 9 units away from A, and B is 6 units away from A towards O. So OB = OA + AB? Wait, no. If A is the center of ω₁, and O is the center of ω₂, then OA = 9. Since B is the point of tangency, OB is the radius of ω₂, which is 15, and AB is the radius of ω₁, which is 6. Wait, but OA is 9, so OB would be OA + AB only if A is between O and B. But OB is 15, OA is 9, so AB would be OB - OA = 15 - 9 = 6. Yes, that makes sense. So O is 9 units from A, B is 15 units from O, and B is 6 units from A. Therefore, A lies between O and B, with OA = 9, AB = 6, so OB = OA + AB = 15.

      "reasoning_step": "Now, points C and D lie on ω₂ such that BC is a diameter of ω₂. Since BC is a diameter, C is diametrically opposite to B on ω₂. So BC has length 2*15=30, but wait, ω₂ has radius 15, so diameter BC is 30. Wait, but OB is 15, so BC is a diameter, so point C is on the opposite end of ω₂ from B. Therefore, the center O is the midpoint of BC. Wait, but BC is a diameter, so O must be the midpoint. But O is already the center of ω₂, so yes, BC is a diameter, so O is the midpoint of BC. Therefore, BO = OC = 15. But OB is 15, so OC is 15, so point C is 15 units from O, opposite to B. Therefore, coordinates might help here. Let's assign coordinates.\n\nLet me set up a coordinate system. Let’s place point O at the origin (0,0). Then, since OA is 9 units, and point A is between O and B, with OB = 15, AB = 6. So point B is 15 units from O along the x-axis. Therefore, O is (0,0), A is (9,0), B is (15,0). Then, BC is a diameter of ω₂, so since B is (15,0), C must be (-15,0), because the center O is the midpoint of BC. Wait, but BC is a diameter, so if B is (15,0), then C is (-15,0). But wait, O is the center at (0,0), so yes, midpoint of BC is ( (15 + (-15))/2, (0 + 0)/2 ) = (0,0), which is O. So BC is horizontal diameter from (-15,0) to (15,0). Wait, but in the problem statement, BC is a diameter of ω₂, so BC is length 30. Wait, but in our setup, OB is 15, OC is 15, so BC is 30. But in the problem, ω₂ has radius 15, so diameter BC is 30. That's correct.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, it says \"Points C and D lie on ω₂ such that BC is a diameter of ω₂ and BC ⊥ AD\". Wait, BC is horizontal in our coordinate system, so AD must be vertical? Because BC is horizontal and BC is perpendicular to AD. So AD is vertical. So point D is somewhere on ω₂ such that AD is vertical. Since A is at (9,0), AD being vertical would mean that D has the same x-coordinate as A, which is 9. So D is (9, y) on ω₂. Since ω₂ is centered at O (0,0) with radius 15, the equation of ω₂ is x² + y² = 225. So point D is (9, y) on ω₂, so substituting x=9, we get 9² + y² = 225 => 81 + y² = 225 => y² = 144 => y = 12 or y = -12. So D is either (9,12) or (9,-12). The problem says \"D is closer to FG than to EH\". Hmm, need to figure out which one it is. Let's note that.\n\nBut before that, let's recap:\n\n- O is at (0,0), center of ω₂ with radius 15.\n\n- A is at (9,0), center of ω₁ with radius 6.\n\n- B is at (15,0), point of tangency.\n\n- C is at (-15,0), since BC is a diameter.\n\n- AD is vertical, so D is (9,12) or (9,-12). Depending on the rectangle EFGH's position, we can figure out which D it is.",

Therefore, GH is on the left, EF on the right. Similarly, \"D is closer to FG than to EH\". D is either (9,12) or (9,-12). Let's assume D is (9,12) for now. FG is the top horizontal side, EH is the bottom horizontal side. If D is above the rectangle, then being closer to FG (top) than EH (bottom) would make sense. Alternatively, if D is below, maybe. Let's figure out.\n\nFirst, let's assume D is (9,12). Then D is above the circle ω₁, since ω₁ is centered at (9,0) with radius 6, so the topmost point is (9,6). So D is outside ω₁. Similarly, if D were (9,-12), it would be below. The problem says \"D is closer to FG than to EH\". FG is a horizontal side; EH is the other horizontal side. If D is above, then FG is the top side, EH is the bottom side. So if D is above, then distance from D to FG (top) is less than distance to EH (bottom). Since D is at (9,12), and FG is somewhere inside ω₁ (which goes up to y=6), the distance from D to FG would be 12 - y_FG, and distance to EH would be 12 - y_EH, but since EH is lower than FG (as FG is top, EH is bottom), y_EH < y_FG. Wait, actually, if FG is the top side, then EH is the bottom side. So the vertical distance from D (9,12) to FG is 12 - y_FG, and to EH is 12 - y_EH. But since y_EH < y_FG, then 12 - y_EH > 12 - y_FG. Therefore, the distance to EH is greater, so D is closer to FG than to EH. Therefore, if D is (9,12), then this condition holds. Similarly, if D were (9,-12), then distance to FG (which would be lower if FG is bottom?) Wait, no, FG is a horizontal side; depending on the rectangle's orientation.\n\nWait, EFGH is a rectangle with vertical sides EF and GH. Let's define the rectangle such that EF is the right side and GH is the left side (since C is closer to GH). Then, moving around the rectangle, E-F-G-H-E. So EF is vertical right side, FG is horizontal top side, GH is vertical left side, HE is horizontal bottom side. Therefore, FG is top, EH is bottom. Therefore, if D is (9,12), above the circle, then distance from D to FG (top) is less than distance to EH (bottom). If D were (9,-12), below the circle, distance to EH (bottom) would be less. But the problem states \"D is closer to FG than to EH\", so if FG is top, D must be above. Hence, D is (9,12).\n\nTherefore, D is at (9,12).\n\nNow, the problem states that triangles DGF and CHG have equal areas. We need to find the area of rectangle EFGH.",

Since ω₁ is centered at (9,0), any point on ω₁ satisfies (x - 9)² + y² = 36.\n\nLet’s suppose the rectangle EFGH has its sides vertical and horizontal. Let’s denote E as (h, k), F as (h, l), G as (m, l), H as (m, k). Since EF is vertical, GH is vertical, FG and EH are horizontal. The rectangle must satisfy all four points lying on ω₁.\n\nTherefore:\n\nE: (h, k) on ω₁: (h - 9)^2 + k^2 = 36\n\nF: (h, l) on ω₁: (h - 9)^2 + l^2 = 36\n\nG: (m, l) on ω₁: (m - 9)^2 + l^2 = 36\n\nH: (m, k) on ω₁: (m - 9)^2 + k^2 = 36\n\nSince EFGH is a rectangle, the sides EF and GH are vertical, so h and m are the x-coordinates of the vertical sides, and k and l are the y-coordinates of the horizontal sides.

Subtracting these equations gives l^2 - k^2 = 0 => (l - k)(l + k) = 0. Since l ≠ k (otherwise the rectangle would collapse to a line), we have l = -k. So the vertical sides have length |l - k| = | -k - k | = 2|k|. Therefore, the vertical sides are symmetric about the x-axis. Similarly, points E and H: (h - 9)^2 + k^2 = 36 and (m - 9)^2 + k^2 = 36. Subtracting gives (m - 9)^2 - (h - 9)^2 = 0 => (m - 9 - h + 9)(m - 9 + h - 9) = 0 => (m - h)(m + h - 18) = 0. Since m ≠ h (otherwise the rectangle would collapse), we have m + h - 18 = 0 => m = 18 - h. Therefore, the horizontal sides are symmetric about the center (9,0).

So the rectangle is centered at (9,0), with horizontal sides at y = k and y = -k, and vertical sides at x = h and x = 18 - h. The vertical side length is 2k (distance from y=k to y=-k is 2k), and horizontal side length is 2(18 - h - h)/2 = 18 - 2h. Wait, no. Wait, the horizontal length is |m - h| = |18 - h - h| = |18 - 2h|. Since h < m (because EF is the right side and GH is the left side? Wait, earlier we thought GH is left and EF is right because C is closer to GH. Wait, if m = 18 - h, then if h is the x-coordinate of EF (right side), then m = 18 - h would be the x-coordinate of GH (left side). So if h is greater than 9, then m = 18 - h would be less than 9. For example, if h = 12, then m = 6. Therefore, EF is at x=12 (right side), GH at x=6 (left side). Then, the horizontal length is 12 - 6 = 6. Wait, but |m - h| = |18 - h - h| = |18 - 2h|. So if h = 12, |18 - 24| = 6, which matches. So the horizontal side length is |18 - 2h|, and vertical side length is 2k.\n\nBut since the rectangle is inscribed in the circle, we can relate h and k. From point E: (h - 9)^2 + k^2 = 36. So (h - 9)^2 + k^2 = 36. Also, since the horizontal side length is |18 - 2h| and vertical side length is 2|k|, the area of the rectangle is |18 - 2h| * 2|k| = 2|18 - 2h||k|. But since h and k can be positive or negative, but given the symmetry, let's assume h > 9 (so EF is on the right side) and k > 0 (so the top side is at y=k). Therefore, area = 2(18 - 2h) * 2k = 4k(9 - h). Wait, no. Wait, if h > 9, then 18 - 2h = 18 - 2h, which is negative if h > 9. Wait, h is greater than 9, so 18 - 2h = 18 - 2h. If h is 12, 18 - 24 = -6, but absolute value is 6, so area is 2*6*2k = 24k? Wait, maybe I need to be careful with signs.\n\nAlternatively, since h > 9, m = 18 - h < 9. The horizontal length is h - m = h - (18 - h) = 2h - 18. Since h > 9, this is positive. The vertical length is k - (-k) = 2k. Therefore, area = (2h - 18)(2k). So area = 4k(h - 9). But from the equation of the circle: (h - 9)^2 + k^2 = 36. Let's denote (h - 9) = a, so a^2 + k^2 = 36. Then area = 4k * a. So area = 4ak.

Let's check possible ranges for h.\n\nSince the rectangle is inscribed in ω₁ (radius 6 centered at (9,0)), the x-coordinate h must satisfy (h - 9)^2 + k^2 = 36. Since h > 9, h - 9 ranges from 0 to 6 (since radius is 6). Therefore, h ranges from 9 to 15. Therefore, 18 - 2h: when h =9, 18 -18=0; when h=15, 18 -30= -12. So 18 - 2h is negative for h >9. Therefore, |18 - 2h| = 2h -18.\n\nSimilarly, |h - 33|: since h ≤15, h -33 is negative, so |h -33| = 33 - h.\n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\n(2h -18)(12 + k) = 2k(33 - h)\n\nLet’s expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: (2h -18)(12 + k) = 2h*12 + 2h*k -18*12 -18k = 24h + 2hk -216 -18k\n\nRight side: 2k(33 - h) = 66k - 2hk\n\nSet equal:\n\n24h + 2hk -216 -18k = 66k - 2hk\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n24h + 2hk -216 -18k -66k + 2hk = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n24h + (2hk + 2hk) + (-18k -66k) -216 = 0\n\n24h + 4hk -84k -216 = 0\n\nFactor terms:\n\n24h -84k +4hk -216 =0\n\nFactor:\n\nLet’s factor 12 from first two terms:\n\n12*(2h -7k) + 4hk -216 =0",
