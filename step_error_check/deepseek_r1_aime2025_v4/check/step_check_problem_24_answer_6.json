Then add those two numbers together, n + t. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall that sin(θ) = 0 when θ is an integer multiple of π. So, for f(x) = sin(7π·sin(5x)) to be zero, the argument inside the sine function, which is 7π·sin(5x), must be an integer multiple of π. So, mathematically, that would mean:\n\n7π·sin(5x) = kπ, where k is an integer.\n\nDividing both sides by π gives:\n\n7·sin(5x) = k\n\nSo, sin(5x) = k/7. But since sin(5x) must lie between -1 and 1, k/7 must also lie in that interval. Therefore, k can be any integer such that -7 ≤ k ≤ 7. But since sin(5x) ranges from -1 to 1, k can be from -7 to 7, but let's check:\n\nIf k is from -7 to 7, inclusive, then k/7 ranges from -1 to 1, which matches the range of sin(5x). So, k can be integers -7, -6, ..., 0, ..., 6, 7. That's 15 integer values.",

      "reasoning_step": "But wait, sin(5x) = k/7. Each of these equations will have solutions for x. So, for each valid k, we need to find the number of solutions x in (0, 2π) such that sin(5x) = k/7.\n\nBut sin(5x) = c, where c is a constant between -1 and 1, typically has two solutions per period. However, since the coefficient of x inside the sine is 5, the period of sin(5x) is 2π/5. Therefore, over the interval 0 to 2π, there are 5 periods of sin(5x). So, for each value of c (except for c = ±1 where there's only one solution per period), we'd get 2 solutions per period. But since there are 5 periods, that would be 10 solutions for each c where |c| < 1. But wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, no. For sin(θ) = c, in each period of 2π, there are two solutions if |c| < 1, one solution if c = ±1. So, for sin(5x) = k/7, since 5x is the argument, the period is 2π/5. So, over the interval 0 < x < 2π, the function sin(5x) completes 5 full periods. Therefore, for each k (except k = ±7 where sin(5x) = ±1), we would have 2 solutions per period. So, for each k ≠ ±7, number of solutions is 5 periods * 2 solutions = 10 solutions. But wait, no, that's not exactly right.\n\nWait, actually, sin(θ) = c has two solutions in each 2π interval. So, if θ = 5x, then θ ranges from 0 to 10π as x goes from 0 to 2π. So, θ goes through 5 full periods (each 2π). So, in each 2π interval for θ, sin(θ) = c has two solutions if |c| < 1, one if c = ±1. Therefore, over θ from 0 to 10π, which is 5 periods, sin(θ) = c would have 5*2 = 10 solutions if |c| < 1, and 5 solutions if |c| = 1.\n\nTherefore, translating back to x:\n\nFor each k where |k/7| < 1 (i.e., k from -6 to 6, excluding -7 and 7), sin(5x) = k/7 will have 10 solutions each. For k = ±7, sin(5x) = ±1, which would have 5 solutions each. Wait, but sin(5x) = 1 occurs when 5x = π/2 + 2πn, so x = π/10 + (2π/5)n. Similarly, sin(5x) = -1 occurs when 5x = 3π/2 + 2πn, so x = 3π/10 + (2π/5)n. So, over x from 0 to 2π, n can be 0,1,2,3,4. Therefore, 5 solutions each for k = 7 and k = -7.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let's verify this. Let's take k = 7. Then sin(5x) = 1. The solutions are 5x = π/2 + 2πn, so x = π/(10) + (2π/5)n. For x in (0, 2π), n can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, x = π/10, π/10 + 2π/5, π/10 + 4π/5, π/10 + 6π/5, π/10 + 8π/5. Each of these is within 0 to 2π. So, 5 solutions. Similarly for k = -7, sin(5x) = -1, which gives x = 3π/10 + (2π/5)n, same number of solutions: 5.\n\nTherefore, for k from -6 to 6 (excluding -7 and 7), each k will have 10 solutions. For k = -7 and 7, each has 5 solutions.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Wait, k ranges from -7 to 7. So total k values: 15. But k = -7 and 7 give 5 solutions each, and k from -6 to 6 (which is 13 values) give 10 solutions each. So total number of solutions would be:\n\nFor k = -7 and 7: 2 * 5 = 10\n\nFor k from -6 to 6: 13 * 10 = 130\n\nTotal solutions: 10 + 130 = 140",

So total is 13*10 + 2*5 = 130 +10 =140. So n=140.\n\nBut 140 zeros in the interval 0 to 2π? That seems plausible? Let's see, the function f(x) = sin(7π·sin(5x)) oscillates quite rapidly because of the sin(5x) inside, multiplied by 7π. So sin(5x) has frequency 5/(2π), and then multiplied by 7π, making the argument of the sine function 7π sin(5x), which varies between -7π and 7π. So the sine function sin(7π sin(5x)) will oscillate rapidly as x changes, because sin(5x) is changing with x. So each time sin(5x) crosses a multiple of 1/7, the argument crosses a multiple of π, leading to a zero. Given that sin(5x) crosses each level twice per period, and there are 5 periods in 0 to 2π, so 10 crossings per k. So yeah, 140 zeros.
