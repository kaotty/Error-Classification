Let's start with x₁ = 25/11.\n\nCompute x₂: (1/3)(25/11 + 1/(25/11) - 1) = (1/3)(25/11 + 11/25 - 1). Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, 25/11 is approximately 2.2727, 11/25 is 0.44, subtracting 1 gives 25/11 + 11/25 - 1 = (25/11 - 1) + 11/25 = (14/11) + 11/25. Let me convert these to fractions:\n\n14/11 is 14/11, 11/25 is 11/25. To add them, find a common denominator. 11 and 25 are coprime, so LCD is 275.\n\n14/11 = (14*25)/275 = 350/275\n\n11/25 = (11*11)/275 = 121/275\n\nSo adding them: 350 + 121 = 471, so 471/275. Then multiply by 1/3: (471/275)*(1/3) = 471/825. Simplify 471/825. Let's see if they have a common factor. 471 ÷ 3 = 157, 825 ÷ 3 = 275. So x₂ = 157/275.\n\nOkay, x₂ = 157/275. Now compute x₃ = (1/3)(157/275 + 1/(157/275) - 1). Let's compute each part:\n\nFirst term: 157/275\n\nSecond term: 1/(157/275) = 275/157\n\nThird term: -1\n\nSo x₃ = (1/3)(157/275 + 275/157 - 1). Let's compute inside the parentheses:\n\nCompute 157/275 + 275/157. Let's find a common denominator here as well. The denominators are 275 and 157. Since 275 = 25*11, 157 is prime? Let me check: 157 ÷ 2 no, 3? 1+5+7=13, not divisible by 3. 5? Ends with 7. 7? 157/7 ≈ 22.428... Not integer. 11? 157/11 ≈14.27. So yes, 157 is prime. So LCD is 275*157.\n\nCompute numerator:",

Then 19033 ÷ 5109 = 3*5109=15327, 19033 -15327=3706. GCD(5109,3706). 5109 ÷ 3706=1, remainder 1403. GCD(3706,1403). 3706 ÷1403=2*1403=2806, remainder 900. GCD(1403,900). 1403 ÷900=1, remainder 503. GCD(900,503). 900 ÷503=1, remainder 397. GCD(503,397). 503 ÷397=1, remainder 106. GCD(397,106). 397 ÷106=3*106=318, remainder 79. GCD(106,79). 106 ÷79=1, remainder27. GCD(79,27). 79 ÷27=2*27=54, remainder25. GCD(27,25). 27 ÷25=1, remainder2. GCD(25,2). 25 ÷2=12, remainder1. GCD(2,1). So GCD is 1. Therefore, 19033/43175 is reduced.

So actually, GCD of a₃ and b₃ is 27. Therefore, the reduced fraction is 19,033/43,175.",

So a₂ and b₂ have GCD 3. Then x₂=471/825 reduces to 157/275 (divided by 3).\n\nk=3, a₃=513,891, b₃=1,165,725. GCD is 27, as shown earlier. So GCD(a₃,b₃)=27=3².\n\nk=4: Let's compute a₄ and b₄.\n\na₄= a₃² + b₃² -a₃b₃=513,891² +1,165,725² -513,891*1,165,725\n\nBut this is going to be a huge number. However, since we know that GCD(a₃,b₃)=27, we can factor that out.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a multiplicative pattern here. Since each time, the GCD seems to be 3^{k-1}. For k=1, GCD=1=3⁰. For k=2, GCD=3¹. For k=3, GCD=3². Maybe for k=4, GCD=3³, and so on. If that's the case, then when we reduce x_k = a_k / b_k, we divide numerator and denominator by 3^{k-1}. Therefore, the reduced numerator and denominator would be a_k /3^{k-1} and b_k /3^{k-1}. Let's verify:\n\nFor k=2: a₂=471, b₂=825. Divide by 3¹=3: 471/3=157, 825/3=275. Which matches x₂=157/275.\n\nFor k=3: a₃=513,891, b₃=1,165,725. Divide by 3²=9: 513,891/9=57,099 (Wait, 513,891 ÷9: 9*57,000=513,000; 513,891 -513,000=891; 891 ÷9=99. So total 57,099. Similarly, 1,165,725 ÷9=129,525. Then x₃=57,099/129,525. But earlier we found x₃=19,033/43,175. Wait, but 57,099/129,525 simplifies further. Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 57,099 ÷3=19,033; 129,525 ÷3=43,175. So GCD(a₃/9, b₃/9)=3. So GCD(a₃,b₃)=9*3=27, which matches. So GCD(a₃,b₃)=3²*3=3³? Wait, no:\n\nWait, GCD(a₃,b₃)=27=3³. Then GCD(a₃/3²,b₃/3²)=3. So GCD(a₃,b₃)=3³.\n\nSimilarly, GCD(a₂,b₂)=3¹, GCD(a₁,b₁)=3⁰=1.\n\nSo seems like GCD(a_k,b_k)=3^{k-1}. Therefore, when reducing x_k = a_k / b_k, we divide numerator and denominator by 3^{k-1}, resulting in coprime numbers. Therefore, the reduced numerator m_k = a_k / 3^{k-1}, reduced denominator n_k = b_k / 3^{k-1}. And m_k and n_k are coprime.\n\nTherefore, if we can find a recurrence relation for m_k and n_k, which are coprime, then perhaps we can find a pattern.\n\nGiven that:\n\na_{k+1} = a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k\n\nb_{k+1} = 3 a_k b_k\n\nBut since GCD(a_k,b_k)=3^{k-1}, let me write a_k = 3^{k-1} m_k, b_k =3^{k-1} n_k, where GCD(m_k,n_k)=1.\n\nThen:\n\na_{k+1} = (3^{k-1} m_k)² + (3^{k-1} n_k)² - (3^{k-1} m_k)(3^{k-1} n_k)\n\n= 3^{2(k-1)} m_k² + 3^{2(k-1)} n_k² - 3^{2(k-1)} m_k n_k\n\n= 3^{2(k-1)} (m_k² + n_k² - m_k n_k )\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb_{k+1} =3*(3^{k-1} m_k)*(3^{k-1} n_k )=3^{1 +2(k-1)} m_k n_k=3^{2k -1} m_k n_k\n\nTherefore,\n\na_{k+1} =3^{2(k-1)} (m_k² +n_k² -m_k n_k )\n\nb_{k+1}=3^{2k -1} m_k n_k\n\nBut since GCD(a_{k+1},b_{k+1})=3^{k}, we can write:\n\na_{k+1} =3^{k} m_{k+1}\n\nb_{k+1}=3^{k} n_{k+1}\n\nTherefore,\n\n3^{k} m_{k+1}=3^{2(k-1)} (m_k² +n_k² -m_k n_k )\n\nDivide both sides by 3^{k}:\n\nm_{k+1}=3^{2(k-1)-k} (m_k² +n_k² -m_k n_k )=3^{k -2} (m_k² +n_k² -m_k n_k )\n\nSimilarly,\n\n3^{k} n_{k+1}=3^{2k -1} m_k n_k\n\nDivide both sides by 3^{k}:\n\nn_{k+1}=3^{2k -1 -k} m_k n_k=3^{k -1} m_k n_k\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\nm_{k+1}=3^{k -2} (m_k² +n_k² -m_k n_k )\n\nn_{k+1}=3^{k -1} m_k n_k\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe there's a substitution here. Let's see:\n\nGiven that m_{k+1}=3^{k -2} (m_k² +n_k² -m_k n_k )\n\nand n_{k+1}=3^{k -1} m_k n_k\n\nLet me try to compute m_{k+1} and n_{k+1} for k=1,2,3.\n\nStarting with k=1:\n\nm₁=25, n₁=11 (since a₁=3^{0}*25=25, b₁=3^{0}*11=11)\n\nCompute m₂:\n\nm₂=3^{1 -2}*(25² +11² -25*11)=3^{-1}*(625 +121 -275)= (625+121=746-275=471)/3=471/3=157\n\nn₂=3^{1 -1}*25*11=3^{0}*275=275\n\nSo m₂=157, n₂=275\n\nSimilarly, k=2:\n\nm₃=3^{2 -2}*(157² +275² -157*275)=3^{0}*(24,649 +75,625 -43,175)= (24,649 +75,625=100,274 -43,175=57,099)/1=57,099\n\nn₃=3^{2 -1}*157*275=3^{1}*157*275=3*157*275=3*275=825*157=129,675? Wait, 157*275=43,175*3=129,525. Wait, no:\n\nWait, n₃=3^{1}*157*275=3*(157*275). Compute 157*275:\n\n157*200=31,400; 157*75=11,775; total=31,400+11,775=43,175. Multiply by 3:43,175*3=129,525.

The correct observation is a3 and b3 are divisible by 3^3, and a3/9 and b3/9 are divisible by 3 (giving GCD 3), not that the gcd becomes 1/3.\",\n    \"Method_Consistency\": true,\n    \"Step_Relation\": [\n        {\n            \"Parent_Step\": \"Step 14\",\n            \"Relation\": \"Review\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"Parent_Step\": \"Step 16\",\n            \"Relation\": \"Review\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"Summary\": \"Clarify factorization: a3=3^3·19033, b3=3^3·43175\"\n}\n</output>"

Then:\n\ns_{k+1} = (s_k)/3 +3/s_k -1\n\nSo s_{k+1} = (s_k)/3 +3/s_k -1\n\nWhich is similar to the original recurrence but with coefficients changed. Original recurrence was x_{k+1} = (x_k +1/x_k -1)/3. So s_k follows a similar recurrence but with an extra term.\n\nThis doesn't seem to help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that the sequence converges to 1/2, as earlier fixed point analysis suggested. Then for large k, x_k ≈1/2 +ε_k, where ε_k is small. Let's perform a Taylor expansion around 1/2.\n\nLet x_k =1/2 +ε_k. Then 1/x_k ≈2 -4ε_k +8ε_k² -... (using the expansion 1/(1/2 +ε) =2/(1 +2ε) ≈2(1 -2ε +4ε² -...))\n\nSo substituting into the recurrence:\n\nx_{k+1} ≈(1/3)(1/2 +ε_k +2 -4ε_k +8ε_k² -1 )\n\nSimplify inside:\n\n1/2 +ε_k +2 -4ε_k +8ε_k² -1 = (1/2 +2 -1) + (ε_k -4ε_k) +8ε_k² = 3/2 -3ε_k +8ε_k²\n\nThus x_{k+1}≈(1/3)(3/2 -3ε_k +8ε_k²)=1/2 -ε_k + (8/3)ε_k²\n\nBut x_{k+1}=1/2 +ε_{k+1}, so:\n\n1/2 +ε_{k+1}≈1/2 -ε_k + (8/3)ε_k²\n\nTherefore, ε_{k+1}≈-ε_k + (8/3)ε_k²\n\nFor small ε_k, the term (8/3)ε_k² is negligible compared to -ε_k. So approximately, ε_{k+1}≈-ε_k, suggesting that the error alternates sign and decreases in magnitude if |ε_{k+1}| < |ε_k|. However, the coefficient here is -1, so ε_{k+1}≈-ε_k, implying that the error alternates but doesn't decay, which contradicts the convergence. Therefore, the linear term suggests that the error alternates but doesn't decay, but the quadratic term might affect the long-term behavior. However, this is only a heuristic argument. In reality, the behavior might be more complex.\n\nGiven that manual computation shows that x₁=25/11≈2.2727, x₂≈0.571, x₃≈0.440, x₄ would be... Let's compute x₄ using x₃=19,033/43,175≈0.440.\n\nCompute x₄=(1/3)(19,033/43,175 +43,175/19,033 -1)\n\nFirst, compute 43,175/19,033≈2.268. So:\n\n19,033/43,175≈0.440 +2.268≈2.708 -1≈1.708. Multiply by 1/3≈0.569. So x₄≈0.569. Then x₅ would be (1/3)(0.569 +1/0.569 -1). Compute 1/0.569≈1.757. So 0.569 +1.757≈2.326 -1≈1.326. Multiply by 1/3≈0.442. So x₅≈0.442. Then x₆≈(1/3)(0.442 +1/0.442 -1). Compute 1/0.442≈2.262. So 0.442 +2.262≈2.704 -1≈1.704. Multiply by 1/3≈0.568. So x₆≈0.568. So it seems like the sequence is oscillating around 0.5, getting closer each time? From x₃≈0.440, x₄≈0.569, x₅≈0.442, x₆≈0.568, x₇≈0.443, etc., converging towards 0.5. But since the problem asks for x_{2025}, which is odd, 2025=2*1012 +1, so if the sequence alternates between ~0.44 and ~0.56, converging slowly, then x_{2025} would be on the lower side. But this is just approximate. However, the problem states that x_{2025} can be expressed as m/n with m and n coprime, so it must be a precise fraction. Given the earlier terms, the fractions are getting more complex, so likely there's a pattern or a linear recurrence that can be solved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recurrence can be transformed into a linear recurrence through substitution. Let's consider the following idea:\n\nSuppose we let y_k = x_k -1/2. Then substituting into the recurrence:\n\nx_{k+1} = (1/3)(x_k +1/x_k -1)\n\nExpress in terms of y_k:\n\nx_{k+1} = (1/3)( (1/2 + y_k) +1/(1/2 + y_k) -1 )\n\nSimplify 1/(1/2 + y_k):\n\n= 1/(1/2 + y_k) = 2/(1 + 2y_k) ≈2(1 -2y_k +4y_k² -8y_k³ +...) using the expansion 1/(1 +t) ≈1 -t +t² -t³ +... for small t.\n\nAssuming y_k is small (since converging to 1/2), then:\n\nx_{k+1} ≈(1/3)(1/2 + y_k +2(1 -2y_k +4y_k²) -1 )\n\nCompute inside:\n\n1/2 + y_k +2 -4y_k +8y_k² -1 = (1/2 +2 -1) + (y_k -4y_k) +8y_k² = 3/2 -3y_k +8y_k²\n\nMultiply by 1/3:\n\nx_{k+1}≈1/2 -y_k + (8/3)y_k²\n\nBut x_{k+1}=1/2 +y_{k+1}, so:\n\n1/2 +y_{k+1}≈1/2 -y_k + (8/3)y_k²\n\nTherefore, y_{k+1}≈-y_k + (8/3)y_k²\n\nThis suggests that for small y_k, the error term y_{k+1} ≈-y_k, leading to oscillations. However, the quadratic term may cause the amplitude to decrease if y_k is positive or negative. However, this is a heuristic approximation and may not hold for larger y_k.",

Let's try summing from k=1 to k=n:\n\nSum_{k=1}^n [1/x_k] = Sum_{k=1}^n [3x_{k+1} +1 -x_k]\n\nRight-hand side:\n\nSum_{k=1}^n [3x_{k+1} -x_k +1] =3Sum_{k=1}^n x_{k+1} -Sum_{k=1}^n x_k +Sum_{k=1}^n1\n\n=3(Sum_{k=2}^{n+1}x_k) -Sum_{k=1}^n x_k +n\n\n=3Sum_{k=2}^{n+1}x_k -Sum_{k=1}^n x_k +n\n\n=3(Sum_{k=1}^{n+1}x_k -x₁) -Sum_{k=1}^n x_k +n\n\n=3Sum_{k=1}^{n+1}x_k -3x₁ -Sum_{k=1}^n x_k +n\n\n= (3Sum_{k=1}^{n+1}x_k -Sum_{k=1}^n x_k) -3x₁ +n\n\n= (3Sum_{k=1}^{n}x_k +3x_{n+1} -Sum_{k=1}^n x_k) -3x₁ +n\n\n= (2Sum_{k=1}^n x_k +3x_{n+1}) -3x₁ +n\n\nTherefore:\n\nSum_{k=1}^n [1/x_k] =2Sum_{k=1}^n x_k +3x_{n+1} -3x₁ +n\n\nRearranged:\n\nSum_{k=1}^n [1/x_k -2x_k] =3x_{n+1} -3x₁ +n\n\nThis is an interesting relation. Let's write it as:\n\nSum_{k=1}^n [1/x_k -2x_k] =3x_{n+1} -3x₁ +n\n\nNow, if we can compute this sum or relate it to something else, perhaps we can find a closed-form expression for x_{n+1}.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Let's compute the left-hand side for small n and see if there's a pattern.\n\nFor n=1:\n\nLHS=1/x₁ -2x₁=11/25 -2*(25/11)=11/25 -50/11=(121 -1250)/275=(-1129)/275\n\nRHS=3x₂ -3x₁ +1=3*(157/275) -3*(25/11) +1=471/275 -75/11 +1=471/275 -75/11 +275/275=471/275 -1875/275 +275/275=(471 -1875 +275)/275=(-1129)/275\n\nSo equality holds for n=1.\n\nFor n=2:\n\nLHS=Sum_{k=1}^2 [1/x_k -2x_k]=(-1129)/275 + [1/x₂ -2x₂]= (-1129)/275 + [275/157 -2*(157/275)]\n\nCompute275/157≈1.751, 2*(157/275)=314/275≈1.1418. So275/157 -314/275= (275² -314*157)/(157*275)\n\nCompute numerator:275²=75,625;314*157=314*150 +314*7=47,100 +2,198=49,298. So75,625 -49,298=26,327\n\nThus LHS=(-1129)/275 +26,327/(157*275)= (-1129*157 +26,327)/ (157*275)\n\nCompute numerator:-1129*157 +26,327. Let's compute1129*157:\n\n1000*157=157,000\n\n129*157= (130-1)*157=130*157 -157=20,410 -157=20,253\n\nTotal:157,000 +20,253=177,253\n\nThus numerator=-177,253 +26,327= -150,926\n\nSo LHS=-150,926/(157*275)\n\nRHS=3x₃ -3x₁ +2=3*(19,033/43,175) -3*(25/11) +2=57,099/43,175 -75/11 +2\n\nConvert to common denominator, say 43,175:\n\n57,099/43,175 -75/11=57,099/43,175 - (75*3925)/43,175=57,099/43,175 -294,375/43,175= -237,276/43,175\n\nAdd 2=86,350/43,175\n\nTotal RHS= (-237,276 +86,350)/43,175= (-150,926)/43,175\n\nBut denominator on RHS is43,175=157*275. Thus RHS= -150,926/(157*275), same as LHS. So equality holds for n=2.\n\nTherefore, the telescoping sum works for n=1,2. So general formula:\n\nSum_{k=1}^n [1/x_k -2x_k] =3x_{n+1} -3x₁ +n\n\nThis seems promising. However, how can we use this to find x_{n}?\n\nIf we can compute the sum on the left-hand side, we could solve for x_{n+1}. But unless the sum telescopes further or relates to a known sequence, this might not help.",

For example, if after some k, x_{k}≡x_{k+1} mod something, but this is speculative.\n\nGiven the time I've spent without progress, I think I need to consider that this problem might require an insight that I'm missing. Let me revisit the original recurrence:\n\nx_{k+1} = (x_k +1/x_k -1)/3\n\nLet me consider writing this as:\n\n3x_{k+1} +1 =x_k +1/x_k\n\nLet me denote u_k =x_k +1/x_k, then:\n\n3x_{k+1} +1 =u_k\n\nAlso, note that u_{k+1}=x_{k+1} +1/x_{k+1}\n\nBut from the first equation, u_k=3x_{k+1} +1. Therefore:\n\nu_{k+1}=x_{k+1} +1/x_{k+1}= (u_k -1)/3 +3/(u_k -1)\n\nThis gives:\n\nu_{k+1}= (u_k -1)/3 +3/(u_k -1)\n\nLet me denote v_k=u_k -2. Then:\n\nu_k= v_k +2\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nu_{k+1}= (v_k +2 -1)/3 +3/(v_k +2 -1)= (v_k +1)/3 +3/(v_k +1)\n\nThus:\n\nu_{k+1}= (v_k +1)/3 +3/(v_k +1)\n\nBut u_{k+1}=v_{k+1} +2, so:\n\nv_{k+1} +2= (v_k +1)/3 +3/(v_k +1)\n\nRearranged:\n\nv_{k+1}= (v_k +1)/3 +3/(v_k +1) -2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (v_k +1)/3 -2 +3/(v_k +1)\n\n= (v_k +1 -6)/3 +3/(v_k +1)\n\n= (v_k -5)/3 +3/(v_k +1)\n\nThis still looks complicated. Let me compute the first few terms of v_k:\n\nu₁=x₁ +1/x₁=25/11 +11/25=746/275≈2.7127. Thus v₁=u₁ -2≈0.7127\n\nCompute u₂=(v₁ +1)/3 +3/(v₁ +1)= (1.7127)/3 +3/1.7127≈0.5709 +1.751≈2.3219. Thus v₂≈0.3219\n\nSimilarly, u₃=(v₂ +1)/3 +3/(v₂ +1)= (1.3219)/3 +3/1.3219≈0.4406 +2.268≈2.7086. Thus v₃≈0.7086\n\nu₄=(v₃ +1)/3 +3/(v₃ +1)=1.7086/3 +3/1.7086≈0.5695 +1.754≈2.3235. Thus v₄≈0.3235\n\nu₅=(v₄ +1)/3 +3/(v₄ +1)=1.3235/3 +3/1.3235≈0.4412 +2.267≈2.7082. Thus v₅≈0.7082\n\nObserving that v_k oscillates between approximately0.708 and0.323, getting closer each time. This suggests that the sequence u_k is converging to a fixed point. Let's solve for the fixed point v where v= (v +1)/3 +3/(v +1) -2\n\nLet me set v= (v +1)/3 +3/(v +1) -2\n\nMultiply both sides by3(v +1):\n\n3(v +1)v= (v +1)^2 +9 -6(v +1)\n\nExpand:\n\n3v² +3v= v² +2v +1 +9 -6v -6\n\nSimplify right-hand side:\n\nv² +2v +1 +9 -6v -6= v² -4v +4\n\nThus:\n\n3v² +3v= v² -4v +4\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n2v² +7v -4=0\n\nSolve:\n\nv=(-7 ±sqrt(49 +32))/4=(-7 ±sqrt(81))/4=(-7 ±9)/4\n\nPositive solution: (2)/4=0.5\n\nNegative solution: (-16)/4=-4\n\nSince v represents u -2 and u=x +1/x ≥2 (by AM ≥GM), v≥0. Thus the fixed point is v=0.5. Therefore, the sequence v_k converges to0.5, so u_k converges to2.5, and x_k converges to0.5 or2. But since the sequence alternates around0.5, it converges to0.5.\n\nHowever, convergence doesn't help us find the exact value at2025. Given the time invested and lack of progress, I think the answer is likely converges to1/2, but since it's a fraction, perhaps after sufficiently many steps, the terms become1/2. However, starting from25/11, which is not1/2, and applying rational operations, it's impossible to reach1/2 exactly. Therefore, there must be a pattern in the recursion that leads to a linear recurrence which can be solved.",
