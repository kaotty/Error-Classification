The entire 3x9 grid must have each row containing 1-9. Therefore, when we put the three blocks together, the rows must not have duplicate numbers.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to arranging three 3x3 Latin squares (each containing numbers 1-9) such that when placed side by side, each row of the combined grid is a permutation of 1-9.\n\nWait, but each block is not a Latin square. Because a Latin square of order 3 would have each number 1-3 appearing once per row and column. But here, each block has numbers 1-9. So each block is a 3x3 grid with numbers 1-9, each exactly once. So each block is a 3x3 Sudoku subgrid (which in Sudoku is allowed to have numbers 1-9, but in reality, Sudoku subgrids are 3x3 with numbers 1-9 without repetition, yes). So the problem is similar to arranging three Sudoku subgrids horizontally such that each row of the combined grid has all numbers 1-9.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to arranging three Sudoku boxes (3x3 grids with numbers 1-9) side by side such that each row of the resulting 3x9 grid has all numbers 1-9. So how many ways can this be done?\n\nTo approach this, let's consider building the grid one block at a time.\n\nFirst, construct the first block (leftmost 3x3 grid). This block must contain numbers 1-9, so there are 9! ways to arrange it. However, in Sudoku, the number of ways to arrange a single 3x3 block is 9! since all numbers must be present. But wait, in Sudoku, the entire grid has constraints beyond the blocks, but here we only have the blocks and rows. So perhaps the first block can be any permutation of 1-9 in a 3x3 grid.

Let's consider that the entire grid can be viewed as a 3x9 grid where each row is a permutation of 1-9 and each 3x3 block is also a permutation of 1-9. This is similar to a gerechte design, where the grid is partitioned into regions (the blocks) and each region must contain a permutation of 1-9, as well as each row.\n\nGerechte designs are Latin squares partitioned into regions, each of which is also a Latin square. In this case, the grid is 3x9, partitioned into three 3x3 regions, each of which must be a Latin square (but with numbers 1-9), and each row must also be a Latin square (permutation of 1-9). However, gerechte designs typically refer to square grids, but the concept might extend.",

However, the rows and columns of the subgrid are not required to be permutations of 1-9, just distinct within the subgrid. Wait, no. Each row of the entire Sudoku grid must contain 1-9, so each subgrid's row is part of the entire grid's row. Therefore, in the Sudoku puzzle, each subgrid's row must contain three numbers that are part of the entire row's permutation.\n\nBut in our problem, the entire grid is only three rows tall, each divided into three blocks. Each block is a Sudoku subgrid, meaning that within each block's rows and columns, numbers are distinct. However, since each block has three rows and three columns, and must contain numbers 1-9, each block's row and column must contain three distinct numbers. But there are nine numbers to fit into three rows and three columns, so each row and column of the block must contain three distinct numbers, but collectively, all nine numbers are present in the block.\n\nTherefore, each block is a 3x3 grid where each row and column contains three distinct numbers, and all nine numbers are present.

Therefore, perhaps the correct term is a \" gerechte design\" where the grid is partitioned into regions (blocks), and each region contains all symbols.\n\nHowever, I'm not familiar with the exact terminology here. Regardless, the key point is that each block must contain numbers 1-9 with each row and column of the block containing distinct numbers, and each row of the entire grid containing all numbers 1-9.\n\nGiven that, how do we count the number of such arrangements?\n\nLet me refer back to known Sudoku counting techniques. In Sudoku, the first row of the first block can be arranged in 9! ways. The second row of the first block must contain the remaining 6 numbers, split into two groups of 3 that don't conflict with the first row.

This seems like a standard Sudoku first three rows (the first band). Therefore, the number of ways to fill the first band of a Sudoku grid is known.\n\nAccording to Sudoku mathematics, the number of ways to fill the first band (three rows) is:\n\n9! × 56 × 6! × 1 = 9! × 56 × 6!\n\nThis result comes from the following steps:\n\n1. Fill the first block (3x3) with numbers 1-9: 9! ways.\n\n2. For the second block:\n\n   a. Each row in the second block must contain numbers not present in the corresponding row of the first block. There are 6 numbers left for each row.\n\n   b. The number of ways to arrange these numbers in the second block such that each column also contains unique numbers is equivalent to the number of 3x3 Latin squares with 6 symbols, which is 56 × 6!.\n\n3. The third block is then uniquely determined by the numbers not used in the first two blocks for each row.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways is 9! × 56 × 6!.\n\nBut let me verify this.\n\nFirst block: 9! ways.\n\nSecond block: For each row in the second block, we have 6 numbers not in the corresponding row of the first block. We need to arrange these 6 numbers into three cells per row such that each column of the second block contains distinct numbers. This is equivalent to choosing a 3x3 Latin square for the second block, where the symbols are the remaining 6 numbers, partitioned into three pairs. However, this is not straightforward.\n\nActually, the number of ways to arrange the second block is calculated as follows:\n\nAfter choosing the first block, the first row of the second block must choose 3 numbers from the 6 numbers not in the first row of the first block. The second row of the second block must choose 3 numbers from the 6 numbers not in the second row of the first block, but avoiding the numbers already chosen in the first row of the second block. Similarly for the third row.\n\nThis is similar to a 3x3 grid where each row is a combination of 3 numbers from a set of 6, with the constraint that columns don't repeat numbers.\n\nThis problem is known to have 56 × 6! solutions. The factor 56 corresponds to the number of ways to partition the 6 numbers into three pairs for the columns, and 6! corresponds to permuting these pairs.\n\nHowever, I need to break this down.",
