Similarly, S4's top edge is H4 (which is the bottom edge of S2). \n\nSo, edges:\n\nHorizontal edges:\n\nTop row: H1 (S1's top), H2 (S2's top)\n\nMiddle horizontal: H3 (S1's bottom), H4 (S2's bottom)\n\nBottom row: H5 (S3's bottom), H6 (S4's bottom)\n\nVertical edges:\n\nLeftmost: V1 (S1's left), V2 (S3's left)\n\nMiddle verticals: V3 (S1's right, S2's left), V4 (S3's right, S4's left)\n\nRightmost: V5 (S2's right), V6 (S4's right)\n\nTherefore, total edges:\n\nHorizontal: H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6 (6)\n\nVertical: V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6 (6)\n\nTotal 12 edges.\n\nEach unit square must have exactly two red and two blue edges.\n\nLet me consider each square:\n\nS1: edges H1, V3, H3, V1\n\nS2: edges H2, V5, H4, V3\n\nS3: edges H3, V4, H5, V2\n\nS4: edges H4, V6, H6, V4\n\nEach of these squares must have exactly two red and two blue edges.\n\nSo, for each square, the number of red edges is 2, blue edges 2.\n\nSince edges are shared between squares, the color of one edge affects two squares (except for the perimeter edges, which are only part of one square). For example, H1 is only part of S1, so coloring H1 red or blue only affects S1. However, V3 is part of both S1 and S2, so coloring V3 red affects both S1 and S2.\n\nThis interdependency complicates things. So perhaps we can model this as a system of equations or constraints.\n\nEach square imposes that the sum of red edges is 2.

Otherwise, it doesn't.\n\nTherefore, the total number of valid colorings is equal to the number of perimeter colorings (H1, H2, H5, H6, V1, V2, V5, V6) satisfying equation (*), multiplied by the number of solutions (H3, H4, V3, V4) for each such perimeter coloring.\n\nNow, we need to compute:\n\n1. The number of perimeter colorings satisfying (*).\n\n2. For each such perimeter coloring, the number of internal colorings (H3, H4, V3, V4) that satisfy the four equations.\n\nLet me first tackle part 2: For a given perimeter coloring satisfying (*), how many internal colorings are possible?\n\nFrom equations 1 to 4:\n\nEquation 1: H3 + V3 = c1\n\nEquation 2: H4 + V3 = c2\n\nEquation 3: H3 + V4 = c3\n\nEquation 4: H4 + V4 = c4\n\nAssuming that equation (*) holds, which gives c2 + c3 = c1 + c4, the system is consistent.\n\nLet me solve for variables H3, H4, V3, V4.\n\nFrom equations 1 and 2:\n\nFrom equation 1: H3 = c1 - V3\n\nPlug into equation 2: H4 + V3 = c2 => H4 = c2 - V3\n\nFrom equation 3: V4 = c3 - H3 = c3 - (c1 - V3) = c3 - c1 + V3\n\nFrom equation 4: H4 + V4 = c4 => (c2 - V3) + (c3 - c1 + V3) = c4 => c2 + c3 - c1 = c4\n\nWhich is exactly the consistency condition we had earlier. So, once equation (*) is satisfied, the variables can be expressed in terms of V3.\n\nTherefore, once V3 is chosen, H3, H4, V4 are determined.\n\nBut V3 is a binary variable (0 or 1). However, we need to ensure that H3, H4, V4 are also binary (0 or 1). Let's check.\n\nGiven that c1, c2, c3, c4 are constants (since perimeter variables are fixed), let's see:\n\nFrom H3 = c1 - V3\n\nSince H3 must be 0 or 1, c1 - V3 must be 0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nH4 = c2 - V3 must be 0 or 1.\n\nV4 = c3 - c1 + V3 must be 0 or 1.\n\nTherefore, depending on c1, c2, c3, V3 may have 0, 1, or 2 possible values.\n\nWait, but since equation (*) is satisfied, and the system is consistent, there should be at least one solution. Let me check.\n\nSuppose c1, c2, c3, c4 are integers (0,1,2) since they are defined as 2 minus the sum of two binary variables. For example, c1 = 2 - H1 - V1. Since H1 and V1 are each 0 or 1, c1 can be 2, 1, or 0.\n\nSimilarly for c2, c3, c4.\n\nBut given equation (*), which is c2 + c3 = c1 + c4, and each c_i is in {0,1,2}, we can have different possibilities.\n\nHowever, since H3, H4, V3, V4 are binary variables (0 or 1), the expressions c1 - V3, c2 - V3, c3 - c1 + V3 must result in 0 or 1.\n\nLet me consider possible cases for V3.\n\nCase 1: V3 = 0\n\nThen:\n\nH3 = c1 - 0 = c1\n\nH4 = c2 - 0 = c2\n\nV4 = c3 - c1 + 0 = c3 - c1\n\nBut H3 and H4 must be 0 or 1, so c1 and c2 must be 0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, V4 = c3 - c1 must be 0 or 1.\n\nCase 2: V3 = 1\n\nThen:\n\nH3 = c1 - 1\n\nH4 = c2 - 1\n\nV4 = c3 - c1 + 1\n\nAgain, H3 and H4 must be 0 or 1, so c1 - 1 and c2 - 1 must be ≥ 0, i.e., c1 ≥ 1 and c2 ≥ 1. Therefore, c1 and c2 must be 1 or 2.\n\nSimilarly, V4 = c3 - c1 + 1 must be 0 or 1.\n\nTherefore, depending on the values of c1, c2, c3, there may be 0, 1, or 2 possible solutions for V3.\n\nBut since the system is consistent (due to equation (*)), there should be at least one solution.",

However, since we need exactly two red edges per square, not just an even number, this is different.\n\nBut perhaps converting the problem into linear algebra modulo 2 could help.\n\nEach square imposes that the sum of its edges is 0 mod 2 (since 2 red edges is 0 mod 2). So if we set up the system modulo 2, the solutions would correspond to colorings where each square has an even number of red edges. However, our problem requires exactly two red edges per square, which is a stricter condition. Therefore, the solution space modulo 2 would include all colorings with 0, 2, or4 red edges per square, but we need only those with exactly 2.\n\nTherefore, this approach might not directly help.\n\nBut perhaps combining parity conditions with additional constraints.\n\nAlternatively, given that each square has exactly two red edges, the number of red edges in the entire grid is 4*2=8, but each internal edge is shared by two squares, so the total number of red edges counted this way is 8 = R + 2I, where R is the number of red perimeter edges and I the number of red internal edges.

Therefore:\n\nPossible I values:\n\nIf I=0: R=8 → impossible, since there are8 perimeter edges. So R=8, I=0.\n\nBut perimeter edges are8, so R=8 is possible.\n\nWait, but each internal edge is shared by two squares, so if I=0, then R=8. But each perimeter edge is only in one square. Therefore, total red edges counted per square would be R + 2I =8 +0=8, which matches 4*2=8.

However, it gives a necessary condition.\n\nBut perhaps combining this with the earlier constraint.\n\nFrom before, we had that the total number of colorings is94. But let's see:\n\nIf I=4 (all internal edges red), then R=0. So all perimeter edges blue. Check if this is valid.\n\nEach square has two red edges. Let's see:\n\nS1: edges H1 (blue), V3 (red), H3 (red), V1 (blue). So two red edges: valid.\n\nS2: H2 (blue), V5 (blue), H4 (red), V3 (red).

The earlier derivation treated the linear consistency condition c2 + c3 = c1 + c4 (equivalently A = B, giving 70 perimeter assignments) as if it were sufficient to guarantee 1 or 2 binary (0/1) solutions for the four internal edges for every such perimeter assignment. That implication is false: the condition is only necessary for integer consistency of the linear system, not sufficient to ensure 0/1 solutions for H3,H4,V3,V4. There exist perimeter choices satisfying (*) for which no binary internal assignment exists (for example c1=c2=2, c3=c4=0 — e.g. H1=V1=H2=V5=0 and V2=H5=V6=H6=1 — satisfies (*) but testing V3=0 gives H3=2 (invalid) and V3=1 gives V4=-1 (invalid)). Thus some of the 70 perimeter assignments contribute 0 internal solutions, so the counting 24*2 + 46*1 = 94 is not justified. The correct reference solution (by case analysis) yields 82, so the conclusion 94 conflicts with the correct result.\",\n    \"Method_Consistency\": false,\n    \"Step_Relation\": [\n        {\n            \"Parent_Step\": \"Step 20\",\n            \"Relation\": \"Progressive\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"Parent_Step\": \"Step 28\",\n            \"Relation\": \"Progressive\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"Parent_Step\": \"Step 31\",\n            \"Relation\": \"Progressive\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"Parent_Step\": \"Step 32\",\n            \"Relation\": \"Progressive\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"Summary\": \"Conclude total colorings = 94\"\n}\n</output>"
