      "reasoning_step": "But wait, x=34y². Let's think about solving for y. So y = ±sqrt(x/34). So, the parabola is symmetric over the x-axis, so intersections will occur at points with positive and negative y-values. However, when we sum the y-coordinates, the positive and negative ones might cancel out? Wait, but the problem says \"the sum of the y-coordinates\". So if there's a point at (x, y) and (x, -y), their sum would be y + (-y) = 0. So maybe only the intersections where y is non-negative contribute? Wait, but maybe not all intersections have symmetric counterparts. Wait, but since f(x) is a function, for each x, there's only one y. Wait, no. Wait, the parabola is x=34y², which is a sideways parabola. So for each y, x is determined. But f(x) is a function y = f(x). So, substituting x=34y² into y = f(x), we get y = f(34y²). So, solving for y in the equation y = f(34y²). Since f is periodic with period 4, f(34y²) is equal to f(34y² mod 4). So, perhaps we can reduce the problem by considering 34y² modulo 4.\n\nLet me compute 34 mod 4. 34 divided by 4 is 8*4=32, remainder 2. So 34 ≡ 2 mod 4. Therefore, 34y² ≡ 2y² mod 4. Therefore, f(34y²) = f(2y² mod 4). So, depending on the value of 2y² mod 4, we can determine which piece of f(x) to use.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to split into cases based on the interval of x. Since f(x) is periodic with period 4, and x=34y², which can be any non-negative real number. So 34y² can be written as 4k + t, where t is in [0,4) and k is a non-negative integer. Therefore, f(34y²) = f(t). Depending on t, which is 34y² - 4k, we can determine whether t is in [0,1) or [1,3) or [3,4). Wait, but the original definition of f(x) is for x in [-1,1) and [1,3). But since x is non-negative here, t is in [0,4). So, mapping back to the original definition, f(x) is defined as x for x in [-1,1), but since t is non-negative, t in [0,1) would correspond to f(t) = t. For t in [1,3), f(t) = 2 - t. For t in [3,4), since f is periodic, f(t) = f(t - 4). But t - 4 would be in [-1,0). So, f(t) = f(t - 4) = t - 4, because for x in [-1,1), f(x) = x. So, for t in [3,4), f(t) = t - 4.\n\nTherefore, summarizing:\n\nFor x = 4k + t, where t ∈ [0,4):\n\n- If t ∈ [0,1): f(x) = t\n- If t ∈ [1,3): f(x) = 2 - t\n- If t ∈ [3,4): f(x) = t - 4\n\nTherefore, substituting x = 34y² into f(x), we have:\n\nIf 34y² = 4k + t, then f(34y²) = f(t) as above.\n\nBut since we have the equation y = f(34y²), substituting gives:\n\ny = f(t) where t = 34y² - 4k.\n\nTherefore, depending on the value of t (which depends on k), we can split into cases.\n\nCase 1: t ∈ [0,1). Then y = t = 34y² - 4k. So:\n\ny = 34y² - 4k\n\nWhich rearranges to:\n\n34y² - y - 4k = 0\n\nCase 2: t ∈ [1,3). Then y = 2 - t = 2 - (34y² - 4k). So:\n\ny = 2 - (34y² - 4k) = 2 - 34y² + 4k\n\nRearranging:\n\n34y² + y - (4k + 2) = 0\n\nCase 3: t ∈ [3,4). Then y = t - 4 = (34y² - 4k) - 4 = 34y² - 4k - 4\n\nSo:\n\ny = 34y² - 4k - 4\n\nRearranging:\n\n34y² - y - 4k - 4 = 0\n\nSo, for each k, we can have equations in these cases. However, since x = 34y² must be equal to 4k + t where t is in the respective interval, so:\n\nFor Case 1: t ∈ [0,1) => 34y² = 4k + t => 4k ≤ 34y² < 4k + 1\n\nSimilarly, Case 2: t ∈ [1,3) => 4k + 1 ≤ 34y² < 4k + 3\n\nCase 3: t ∈ [3,4) => 4k + 3 ≤ 34y² < 4k + 4\n\nBut since x = 34y² must be non-negative, k is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...). So we need to find all k such that 34y² ≥ 4k, and solve for y in each case.\n\nBut since 34y² can be very large, but the problem states that there are finitely many intersection points. Therefore, there must be a finite number of k where these equations have real solutions. Therefore, we need to find all possible k such that the quadratic equations in each case have real solutions y, and then check whether those solutions satisfy the inequalities for t in each case.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe manageable.",

So, depending on 2y² mod 4, we can determine which piece of f to use.\n\nBut 2y² mod 4 can be in [0,4). Let's analyze 2y² mod 4.\n\nLet’s note that y² is always non-negative, so 2y² is non-negative.\n\nLet’s let z = 2y². Then z mod 4 can be in [0,4).

Then, equation y = z - 4 = 2y² - 4.\n\nBut since f is periodic every 4, and we reduced the problem to z = 2y² mod 4. However, perhaps this approach simplifies things? Let's see.\n\nSo, solving y = f(34y²) = f(2y² mod 4). Therefore, we can split into three cases based on the value of 2y² mod 4.\n\nCase 1: 2y² mod 4 ∈ [0,1). Then, y = 2y² mod 4.

Then, y = 2y² - 4k => y = 2y² - 4k => 2y² - y - 4k = 0.\n\nSimilarly, Case 2: 2y² mod 4 ∈ [1,3). Then, y = 2 - (2y² - 4k) => y = 2 - 2y² + 4k => 2y² + y - (4k + 2) = 0.\n\nCase 3: 2y² mod 4 ∈ [3,4).

Wait, t=34y² -4k. For k=0, t=34y². So Case3 for k=0 requires t ∈[3,4), which implies 34y² ∈[3,4). So solving 34y² - y -4=0 gives solutions y=(1 ±sqrt(545))/68. Positive solution gives 34y²≈4.352, which is outside [3,4). Negative solution gives≈3.658, which is inside [3,4).

Since f is periodic with period4, f(34y²)=f(34y² mod4). So y=f(34y² mod4).\n\nLet’s denote t=34y² mod4. As before, since34≡2 mod4, t=2y² mod4. So y=f(t).\n\nBut t=2y² mod4, so t=2y² -4k for some integer k≥0 such that t∈[0,4).\n\nTherefore, y=f(t)=f(2y² -4k).\n\nDepending on t's interval:\n\nIf t ∈[0,1): y=t=2y² -4k =>2y² - y -4k=0.\n\nIf t ∈[1,3): y=2 -t=2 - (2y² -4k)=2 -2y² +4k =>2y² + y -4k -2=0.\n\nIf t ∈[3,4): y=t -4=2y² -4k -4 =>2y² - y -4k -4=0.\n\nThese are scaled versions of our previous equations. Multiplying by17 gives the previous equations (since34=2*17). Therefore, scaling factor.\n\nBut perhaps this approach isn't helping. Let's return to the original problem.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that over one period, the sum of y-coordinates cancels out except for certain terms, and over multiple periods, the sum accumulates.\n\nBut in our k=0 case, the sum was (1 -sqrt(545))/68. Maybe for other k's, similar terms appear, and when summed over all k, they telescope.\n\nBut we need to find all k where the equations have solutions.\n\nGiven that |y| ≤1 (since f(x) is bounded between -1 and1), then x=34y² ≤34*1=34. Therefore, k can be from0 to8, since4*8=32<34 and4*9=36>34.\n\nTherefore, k=0 tok=8.\n\nFor each k=0 tok=8, we need to solve the three cases and sum the valid y-coordinates.\n\nThis seems tedious, but perhaps there's a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, notice that for each valid solution y, there is a corresponding solution -y unless y=0. But in our k=0 case, we had solutions at y=0, y=1/34, and others which came in ± pairs. However, the sum didn't cancel completely because some solutions didn't have counterparts.\n\nWait, but in k=0, sum was (1 -sqrt(545))/68≈-0.328.

      "reasoning_step": "Alternatively, consider that for each positive solution y, there is a corresponding negative solution -y, but due to the function f(x) being asymmetric in certain intervals, the sums don't cancel completely.\n\nHowever, the problem states the sum can be expressed in the form (a +b√c)/d, suggesting a simple expression with a single square root. Therefore, our earlier detailed summation leading to multiple square roots must be incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nPerhaps notice that the function f(x) over one period from x=0 to4 is symmetric about x=2. Similarly, the parabola x=34y² is symmetric about the x-axis. Therefore, intersections may occur symmetrically, leading to cancellation of y-coordinates. However, the origin (0,0) is its own symmetric point, and other points may have pairs (y, -y) whose sum is zero. However, in our k=0 case, we had y=0, y=1/34, and three other points with y positive and negative. The sum didn't cancel to zero.\n\nBut maybe over all periods, the sum cancels except for certain terms.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the equation y = f(34y²) implies that y must satisfy y = f(34y²), and since f(x) has period4, we can write y = f(34y² -4k) for some integer k such that34y² -4k ∈[0,4).\n\nTherefore, for each k, solve y = f(t) where t=34y² -4k ∈[0,4).\n\nThis gives three cases:\n\nIf t ∈[0,1): y = t =34y² -4k =>34y² - y -4k=0.\n\nIf t ∈[1,3): y =2 -t =2 -34y² +4k =>34y² + y -4k -2=0.\n\nIf t ∈[3,4): y =t -4 =34y² -4k -4 =>34y² - y -4k -4=0.\n\nThese are the same quadratic equations as before.\n\nNow, suppose we consider all possible k such that these equations have real solutions y.\n\nGiven that |y| ≤1 (since f(x) ∈[-1,1]), x=34y² ≤34, so k can be from0 to8 (since4*8=32<34).\n\nFor each k, solve the three quadratics and sum the valid roots.\n\nBut earlier detailed computation led to a complex expression with multiple square roots, which doesn't match the problem's expected answer form. Therefore, likely that there's a different approach.\n\nAlternative idea:\n\nThe intersection points satisfy x=34y² and y=f(x). Therefore, substituting, y=f(34y²). Since f is periodic with period4, f(34y²)=f(34y² mod4).\n\nLet’s denote z=34y² mod4. Since34≡2 mod4, z=2y² mod4.\n\nTherefore, y=f(z), where z=2y² mod4.\n\nSo we have y=f(z) and z=2y² mod4.\n\nThis creates a system of equations:\n\ny = f(z)\n\nz = 2y² mod4\n\nBut z ∈[0,4), so we can consider three cases based on z:\n\nCase1:z ∈[0,1). Then y=z.\n\nCase2:z ∈[1,3). Then y=2 -z.\n\nCase3:z ∈[3,4). Then y=z -4.\n\nBut z=2y² mod4.\n\nTherefore:\n\nCase1:z=2y² mod4 ∈[0,1). Then y=z=2y² -4k for some integer k≥0. So 2y² -4k ∈[0,1). Therefore, 4k ≤2y² <4k +1. So 2k ≤y² <2k +0.5. Since y² ≥0, k≥0.\n\nBut y=z=2y² -4k. Therefore, substituting y=2y² -4k:\n\n2y² - y -4k=0.\n\nSimilarly, Case2:z=2y² mod4 ∈[1,3). Then y=2 -z=2 - (2y² -4k)=2 -2y² +4k. So 2y² + y -4k -2=0.\n\nCase3:z=2y² mod4 ∈[3,4). Then y=z -4=2y² -4k -4. So 2y² - y -4k -4=0.\n\nThese are the same quadratic equations scaled by a factor of17.\n\nBut perhaps instead of solving for each k, notice that the equations can be scaled.\n\nLet’s multiply each equation by17:\n\nCase1:34y² -17y -68k=0.\n\nCase2:34y² +17y -68k -34=0.\n\nCase3:34y² -17y -68k -68=0.\n\nBut x=34y², so substituting:\n\nCase1:x -17y =68k.\n\nCase2:x +17y =68k +34.\n\nCase3:x -17y =68k +68.\n\nBut also, y=f(x).\n\nTherefore, combining these equations with y=f(x):\n\nFor Case1:y =x -4m for x ∈[4m,4m +1).\n\nBut x=34y²=68k +17y.\n\nSo substituting y=x -4m into x=68k +17y:\n\nx=68k +17(x -4m)\n\nx=68k +17x -68m\n\nRearranging:\n\nx -17x=68k -68m\n\n-16x=68(k -m)\n\nx= -68(k -m)/16= -17(k -m)/4.\n\nBut x=34y² ≥0. Therefore, -17(k -m)/4 ≥0 =>k -m ≤0 =>m ≥k.\n\nBut m is such that x ∈[4m,4m +1). But x= -17(k -m)/4.\n\nThus:\n\n4m ≤ -17(k -m)/4 <4m +1.\n\nMultiply all terms by4:\n\n16m ≤ -17(k -m) <16m +4.\n\nBut -17(k -m) =17(m -k).\n\nThus:\n\n16m ≤17(m -k) <16m +4.\n\nRearranged:\n\n16m ≤17m -17k <16m +4.\n\nSubtract16m:\n\n0 ≤m -17k <4.\n\nTherefore:\n\n0 ≤m -17k <4.\n\nBut m and k are integers ≥0.\n\nThis implies m=17k +t, where t=0,1,2,3.\n\nBut m ≥k, sincek -m ≤0.\n\nBut m=17k +t ≥k =>17k +t ≥k =>16k +t ≥0, which is always true.\n\nBut x= -17(k -m)/4= -17(k -17k -t)/4= -17(-16k -t)/4=17(16k +t)/4.\n\nBut x=34y²=34(y)^2.\n\nTherefore:\n\n17(16k +t)/4=34y² =>(16k +t)/8= y².\n\nBut y= x -4m=17(16k +t)/4 -4*(17k +t)= (17*16k +17t)/4 -68k -4t= (272k +17t -272k -16t)/4= (t)/4.\n\nTherefore, y=t/4.\n\nBut y²=(t/4)^2= t²/16.\n\nFrom earlier equation:\n\n(16k +t)/8= t²/16.\n\nMultiply both sides by16:\n\n2(16k +t)=t²\n\n32k +2t =t²\n\nt² -2t -32k=0.\n\nSolve for t:\n\nt = [2 ±sqrt(4 +128k)]/2=1 ±sqrt(1 +32k).\n\nBut t must be integer0,1,2,3.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(1 +32k) must be integer ±1.

Since the function repeats every4 units, and the parabola is x=34y², which is symmetric about the x-axis, the intersections would occur at points where y and -y are both solutions. However, since f(x) is a function, each x corresponds to one y. But the parabola x=34y² includes both positive and negative y. Therefore, each intersection at (x,y) implies another at (x,-y) unless y=0.\n\nBut f(x) is a function, so for each x, there's only one y. Therefore, if (x,y) is an intersection point, then (x,-y) is also an intersection point only if f(x)=y and f(x)=-y. Which would require y=0. Therefore, non-zero y-coordinates come in pairs (y, -y) whose sum is zero. Therefore, the total sum of y-coordinates is just the sum of the y-coordinates where y=0.\n\nBut in our k=0 case, we had y=0 as a solution. Are there other y=0 solutions?\n\nYes, at x=0,4,8,...,34. But x=34y²=0 implies y=0. So the only solution with y=0 is at x=0. Therefore, the sum of y-coordinates is zero plus the sum of pairs (y, -y) which cancel out.

Similarly, -y must satisfy -y=f(34(-y)²)=f(34y²).

However, the problem states c is not divisible by the square of any prime, so sqrt(273) is acceptable.\n\nBut in our k=0 case, sum was (1 -sqrt(545))/68. 545=5*109, which is square-free. So the expression (1 -sqrt(545))/68 can be written as (1 -sqrt(545))/68, which fits the form (a +b√c)/d with a=1, b=-1, c=545, d=68. But gcd(1,-1,68)=1, and545 is square-free.
