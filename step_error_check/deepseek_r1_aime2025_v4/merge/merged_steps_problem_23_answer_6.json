    "problem": "From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $ N $ cents, where $ N $ is a positive integer. He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.",

For any amount N, you take as many 25-cent coins as possible without exceeding N, then do the same with 10-cent coins, and then the rest is made up with 1-cent coins. The problem is that sometimes, using fewer higher denomination coins might allow using more of a lower denomination in a way that reduces the total number of coins. For example, in the 42-cent example, instead of 25 + 10 + 7*1 = 9 coins, you can do 4*10 + 2*1 = 6 coins.\n\nSo, the task is to find all N where such a better combination doesn't exist.

So, perhaps the non-greedy approach would involve replacing some 25s with 10s and 1s in such a way that the total number of coins decreases.\n\nWait, let's take the example given: 42 cents. The greedy algorithm uses 25 + 10 + 7*1 = 9 coins. The optimal solution uses 4*10 + 2*1 = 6 coins. Here, instead of using 1 quarter (25), 1 dime (10), and 7 pennies (1), we use 4 dimes and 2 pennies.

So, total 4 + 2 = 6 coins. So, here, avoiding the quarter allows using more dimes and fewer pennies. So, the key is that sometimes, skipping a higher denomination allows you to use a combination of lower denominations that sum to the same total with fewer coins.\n\nSo, in this case, using a quarter leads to needing more pennies, which increases the total coin count. So, the problem arises when using a higher denomination coin forces you into a situation where you need a lot of pennies, which could be replaced by more dimes and fewer pennies if you had not used the higher denomination.\n\nTherefore, the places where the greedy algorithm fails are when there's a point where reducing the number of higher denomination coins allows you to use lower denominations in a way that reduces the total number of coins.\n\nSo, perhaps the critical values are around the transitions where the remainder after using quarters would require a lot of pennies, but using an extra dime (or more) could cover that remainder with fewer coins.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nSuppose we have N. Let’s say we use k quarters. Then the remaining amount is R = N - 25k. For the greedy algorithm, k is as large as possible, i.e., k = floor(N / 25). Then R = N - 25k. Then, for R, we use as many dimes as possible: m = floor(R / 10), and then pennies: p = R - 10m. Total coins: k + m + p.\n\nAn alternative approach would be to use k' quarters, where k' < k, and then more dimes and pennies. Let's see if such a k' exists where (k - k') quarters removed can be compensated by adding dimes and pennies such that the total coins decrease.\n\nEach quarter removed gives back 25 cents. To compensate, we need to add coins summing to 25 cents. The question is, can we add dimes and pennies such that the number of coins added is less than the number of quarters removed? Since each quarter is 1 coin, removing 1 quarter gives us a \"budget\" of 1 fewer coin. So, to maintain the same total, we need to add coins summing to 25 cents using at most 0 coins (which is impossible). Therefore, actually, if we remove 1 quarter, we need to add 25 cents using coins, but each coin added adds to the coin count. Therefore, removing 1 quarter (saving 1 coin) and adding 25 cents using dimes and pennies would require at least 3 coins (2 dimes and 5 pennies: 25 = 2*10 + 5*1, which is 7 coins, but wait, 2 dimes and 5 pennies is 7 coins, which is worse than 1 quarter. Wait, that's not helpful. Wait, maybe another combination?\n\nWait, 25 cents can be made with 25 pennies (25 coins), 2 dimes and 5 pennies (7 coins), or 1 dime and 15 pennies (16 coins). None of these are better than 1 quarter. So, removing a quarter and replacing it with any combination of dimes and pennies would require more coins, which would be worse. Therefore, perhaps removing quarters is not beneficial.",

      "content": "Wait, but why didn't the greedy algorithm pick dimes? Because after using the quarter, the remaining 5 cents can't be a dime. So, the greedy algorithm picks the largest coin possible at each step. So, 25 is picked first, then the remaining 5 can't take a dime, so pennies. But the optimal is to use three dimes. So, here, the problem is that the remainder after using quarters is less than 10, so you have to use pennies. But if instead, you had not used the quarter, you could use more dimes.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is when the remainder after using quarters is between 0 and 10, but if you instead reduce the number of quarters by 1, the new remainder becomes 25 + original remainder, which can be covered by dimes and pennies with fewer coins.\n\nWait, let's formalize this.\n\nSuppose N = 25k + r, where 0 ≤ r < 25. The greedy algorithm uses k quarters, m = floor(r / 10) dimes, and p = r - 10m pennies. Total coins: k + m + p.\n\nIf instead, we use k - 1 quarters, then the remaining amount is 25 + r. Then, we can use m' = floor((25 + r)/10) dimes and p' = (25 + r) - 10m' pennies. The total coins would be (k - 1) + m' + p'. If this total is less than k + m + p, then the greedy algorithm is not optimal.\n\nSo, the difference in coins is: [ (k - 1) + m' + p' ] vs. [ k + m + p ]\n\nWhich simplifies to: (m' + p' - 1) vs. (m + p)\n\nSo, if (m' + p' - 1) < (m + p), then the alternative is better.\n\nTherefore, the condition for the greedy algorithm to fail is:\n\nm' + p' - 1 < m + p\n\nBut m + p = floor(r / 10) + (r - 10*floor(r / 10)) = r // 10 + r % 10 = same as r, since r //10 + r%10 = floor(r /10) + (r -10*floor(r /10)) = r. Wait, no:\n\nWait, m = floor(r /10), p = r -10m. So, m + p = floor(r /10) + (r -10*floor(r /10)) = r - 9*floor(r /10). Wait, no:\n\nWait, if r = 10a + b, where 0 ≤ b <10, then m = a, p = b. So m + p = a + b. But r = 10a + b, so a = floor(r /10), b = r %10. So, m + p = floor(r /10) + r %10.\n\nSimilarly, for the alternative approach: remaining amount is 25 + r. Let’s denote s = 25 + r. Then m' = floor(s /10), p' = s %10. So, m' + p' = floor(s /10) + s %10.\n\nSo, the condition becomes:\n\nfloor(s /10) + s %10 -1 < floor(r /10) + r %10\n\nBut s = 25 + r. Let's write s =25 + r. Then:\n\nfloor((25 + r)/10) + (25 + r)%10 -1 < floor(r /10) + r%10\n\nLet’s compute left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS):\n\nLet’s denote r =10a + b, where a = floor(r /10), b = r%10. Then s =25 +10a + b.\n\nSo, s =25 +10a + b =10*(a +2) + (5 + b). If 5 + b <10, then floor(s /10) =a +2, and s%10 =5 + b. If 5 + b ≥10, then floor(s /10)=a +3, and s%10 =5 + b -10 = b -5.\n\nSo, two cases:\n\nCase 1: 5 + b <10 → b <5.\n\nThen, LHS = (a +2) + (5 + b) -1 = a + b +6 -1 = a + b +5.\n\nRHS = a + b.\n\nThus, LHS = a + b +5, RHS = a + b → LHS - RHS =5. So, 5 <0? No. So in this case, LHS is greater than RHS by 5, so the condition is not met.\n\nCase 2: 5 + b ≥10 → b ≥5.\n\nThen, floor(s /10)=a +3, s%10 = b -5.\n\nThus, LHS = (a +3) + (b -5) -1 = a + b +3 -5 -1 = a + b -3.\n\nRHS = a + b.\n\nSo, LHS - RHS = -3. Therefore, LHS < RHS by 3. So, the condition becomes:\n\na + b -3 < a + b → -3 <0, which is always true.\n\nTherefore, in Case 2 (when b ≥5), the condition is satisfied. Therefore, whenever the remainder r after using k quarters has b ≥5 (i.e., r%10 ≥5), then using k-1 quarters and adjusting the dimes and pennies gives a better coin count.\n\nWait, but let's check with an example. Take N=30. Then N=25*1 +5. So, k=1, r=5. Here, r=5, which is 10a +b with a=0, b=5. So, b=5, which is Case 2. Then LHS = (0 +3) + (5 -5) -1 =3 +0 -1=2. RHS =0 +5=5. So, 2 <5, which is true. Therefore, the alternative approach uses (k-1)=0 quarters, m'= floor(30/10)=3, p'=0. Total coins:0 +3 +0=3, which is better than the greedy's 1 +0 +5=6.",

So, indeed, better. So, the condition holds.\n\nTherefore, the rule seems to be: For N =25k + r, where 0 ≤ r <25, if r%10 ≥5, then the greedy algorithm is not optimal; otherwise, it is optimal.\n\nTherefore, the values of N where the greedy algorithm is optimal are those where, when divided by 25, the remainder r has r%10 <5.

So, for r in 0-24, the possible r%10 digits are 0-9, but since r <25, the possible r%10 are 0-9 for r=0-9, and 0-4 for r=10-14, 10-14%10=0-4, and r=15-24%10=5-4.

But residues r=0-24 correspond to N=1-24 (when k=0) and N=25-1000 (k≥1). Wait, no. For N=1-24, r=N. For N=25-49, r=N-25; etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is that when k=0 (N <25), the remainder r=N. So, for these N, the condition r%10 <5 is not necessary, because there's no alternative with quarters. Therefore, for N <25, all N should be counted as successes, regardless of r%10.\n\nTherefore, our earlier conclusion that there are15 residues r where r%10 <5, each occurring40 times, leading to15*40=600 numbers is incorrect because it includes N=25-1000 where r=0-24, but for N=1-24, even if r%10 ≥5, they are still optimal because there's no way to use quarters.\n\nTherefore, we need to adjust our calculation.\n\nLet’s split the problem into two parts:\n\n1.

Therefore, there's a discrepancy of14 numbers.\n\nThe error arises because residue0 is counted40 times (25,50,...,1000). But1000 is part of residue0 and is included in the blocks. However, when we calculated per residue, we considered residues1-4,10-14,20-24 as each occurring39 times in25-1000. But in reality, each block contributes15 numbers, and40 blocks give600 numbers. Therefore, the correct count from25-1000 is600 numbers.\n\nBut why does the residue-based approach give586? Because it assumes that residues1-4,10-14,20-24 each occur39 times in25-1000. But in reality, each block contributes15 numbers, and40 blocks give600 numbers, which must be correct.\n\nTherefore, the mistake was in the residue-based calculation. The correct approach is:\n\nTotal numbers from25-1000:976 numbers.\n\nEach block of25 numbers contributes15 counted numbers. There are40 blocks (25-49,...,1000). Therefore, total counted numbers:40*15=600.\n\nAdding the24 numbers from1-24:600+24=624.\n\nBut wait,24+600=624. However, according to the small example above, in25-49, there are15 counted numbers. Similarly, each subsequent block contributes15. So, total25-1000:40*15=600. Adding1-24:24. Total624.\n\nBut according to the initial example N=30, which is in25-49 block, r=5, which is not counted. So, N=30 is excluded. Similarly, N=35 is counted (r=10). So, in the first block,15 counted numbers.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the answer is expected to be different. Wait, let's check with N=42.\n\nN=42 is in25-49 block. r=42-25=17. r=17, r%10=7≥5. Therefore, not counted. So, N=42 is excluded. Which matches the example.\n\nSimilarly, N=30:r=5, excluded.\n\nN=35:r=10, included.\n\nSo, the count seems correct. But according to this, total values of N where greedy succeeds is624.",

So,624.\n\nBut I need to verify this with another method.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nFor each N from1 to1000, determine if the greedy algorithm is optimal.\n\nThe greedy algorithm is optimal if and only if there's no way to replace some number of quarters with dimes and pennies to reduce the total coin count.\n\nAs established earlier, this happens when the remainder after using the maximum quarters has r%10 <5.\n\nBut for N <25, the remainder is N itself, and since we can't use quarters, the greedy algorithm for dimes and pennies is always optimal. Therefore, all N from1 to24 are successes.\n\nFor N ≥25, we need to check if r%10 <5, where r =N -25k, k=floor(N/25).\n\nTherefore, total successes:\n\n- N=1-24:24 numbers.\n\n- N=25-1000: numbers where r%10 <5.

      "content": "Wait, another way to think about it: the values for which the greedy algorithm fails are those where there's a number of dimes and pennies that can replace a quarter and some coins to reduce the total count.\n\nSpecifically, replacing a quarter (25 cents) with two dimes and five pennies (25 cents) uses2+5=7 coins instead of1 quarter. But this is worse. However, in the example of N=30, replacing a quarter (25) with three dimes (30) uses3 coins instead of1 quarter and5 pennies (6 coins). So, the saving comes from avoiding the pennies by not using the quarter.\n\nSo, the key is when the remainder after using quarters requires enough pennies that replacing a quarter with dimes eliminates the need for those pennies.\n\nThe amount saved is the number of pennies you would have used minus the number of dimes added.\n\nIn the example of N=30:\n\nGreedy:1 quarter,5 pennies (6 coins).\n\nAlternative:3 dimes (3 coins).\n\nSavings:6 -3=3 coins.\n\nThis happens because by removing1 quarter (-1 coin), you add3 dimes (+3 coins), but eliminate5 pennies (-5 coins). Net change:-1 +3 -5=-3 coins. So total coins saved:3.\n\nSimilarly, for N=42:\n\nGreedy:1 quarter,1 dime,7 pennies (9 coins).\n\nAlternative:4 dimes,2 pennies (6 coins).\n\nSavings:9 -6=3 coins.\n\nNet change from removing1 quarter (-1), adding3 dimes (+3), removing1 dime (-1), and removing7 pennies (-7), adding2 pennies (+2). Total:-1 +3 -1 -7 +2=-4. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the alternative approach doesn't necessarily have to follow removing a quarter and adjusting, but can be a different combination.\n\nBut the key seems to be when the remainder after using quarters has r%10 ≥5, which allows replacing a quarter with dimes and pennies in such a way that the total coins are reduced.\n\nTherefore, the initial conclusion that there are624 values where greedy succeeds seems plausible.\n\nBut let's verify with another example.\n\nTake N=5. Greedy is5 pennies. Optimal. So counted.\n\nN=10. Greedy is1 dime. Optimal. Counted.\n\nN=15. Greedy is1 dime,5 pennies. Optimal. Counted.\n\nN=20. Greedy is2 dimes. Optimal. Counted.\n\nN=25.

    "\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many numbers N between 1 and 1000 inclusive have the property that the greedy algorithm for making change (using 1, 10, and 25-cent coins) uses the minimal number of coins possible. That is, for these N, there's no way to use fewer coins than what the greedy approach gives. ",
    "First, let me recall how the greedy algorithm works here. For any amount N, you take as many 25-cent coins as possible without exceeding N, then do the same with 10-cent coins, and then the rest is made up with 1-cent coins. The problem is that sometimes, using fewer higher denomination coins might allow using more of a lower denomination in a way that reduces the total number of coins. For example, in the 42-cent example, instead of 25 + 10 + 7*1 = 9 coins, you can do 4*10 + 2*1 = 6 coins.\n\nSo, the task is to find all N where such a better combination doesn't exist. That is, the greedy solution is already the optimal one.\n\nTo approach this, I need to compare the number of coins used by the greedy algorithm versus the minimal possible number of coins. If they are equal, then N is counted; otherwise, it isn't. Therefore, I need to check for each N from 1 to 1000 whether the greedy solution is optimal.",
    "But checking each N individually might be computationally intensive if done naively. Instead, perhaps there's a pattern or mathematical structure here that can be exploited.",
    "Let me think about the coin denominations: 1, 10, 25. These are not in a canonical greedy-friendly system. For example, in the US, the denominations are 1, 5, 10, 25, which are canonical, meaning the greedy algorithm always works. But here, we're missing the 5-cent coin, which might lead to situations where the greedy approach isn't optimal.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to determining for each N, whether there exists a combination of 1s, 10s, and 25s that uses fewer coins than the greedy approach.",
    "First, let's formalize the greedy algorithm's coin count. For a given N:\n\n- Let q25 = N // 25 (integer division)\n- r25 = N % 25\n- Then q10 = r25 // 10\n- r10 = r25 % 10\n- q1 = r10\n\nTotal coins greedy = q25 + q10 + q1.\n\nThe minimal coins would be the minimal q25' + q10' + q1' such that 25*q25' + 10*q10' + q1' = N. So, for each N, we need to check if the greedy count is equal to the minimal count.",
    "But computing the minimal count for each N up to 1000 is time-consuming. Instead, perhaps there's a way to characterize the N where the greedy algorithm fails, and subtract those from the total.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern in the values where the greedy algorithm isn't optimal. Let's think about when using a different combination could lead to fewer coins.\n\nSuppose that instead of using as many 25s as possible, using one fewer 25-cent coin allows us to use more 10s or 1s such that the total number of coins is reduced.",
    "Similarly, maybe using fewer 10s allows more 1s but still fewer coins? Wait, since 1s are the smallest denomination, replacing higher coins with 1s would increase the coin count. So, perhaps the non-greedy approach would involve replacing some 25s with 10s and 1s in such a way that the total number of coins decreases.\n\nWait, let's take the example given: 42 cents. The greedy algorithm uses 25 + 10 + 7*1 = 9 coins. The optimal solution uses 4*10 + 2*1 = 6 coins. Here, instead of using 1 quarter (25), 1 dime (10), and 7 pennies (1), we use 4 dimes and 2 pennies. So, replacing a quarter and a dime with more dimes and pennies? Wait, how does that work?\n\nWait, 25 + 10 = 35. If we subtract 35 from 42, we get 7. But instead, 4*10 + 2*1 = 40 + 2 = 42. So, how does this compare? The original approach used 25 + 10 + 7*1. The alternative uses 4*10 + 2*1. So, replacing the 25 and 10 (total coins: 1 + 1 = 2) with 4*10 (4 coins) but adding 2 pennies instead of 7. Wait, but 4*10 + 2*1 is 6 coins versus 1 + 1 + 7 = 9 coins. So, replacing 25 and 10 with more 10s and fewer pennies. Wait, but how does that work?",
    "Wait, 25 + 10 = 35. The remaining 7 is made up with pennies. Alternatively, if you don't use the quarter, you can use 4*10 = 40, which is 40 cents, and then 2 pennies. So, total 4 + 2 = 6 coins. So, here, avoiding the quarter allows using more dimes and fewer pennies. So, the key is that sometimes, skipping a higher denomination allows you to use a combination of lower denominations that sum to the same total with fewer coins.\n\nSo, in this case, using a quarter leads to needing more pennies, which increases the total coin count. So, the problem arises when using a higher denomination coin forces you into a situation where you need a lot of pennies, which could be replaced by more dimes and fewer pennies if you had not used the higher denomination.\n\nTherefore, the places where the greedy algorithm fails are when there's a point where reducing the number of higher denomination coins allows you to use lower denominations in a way that reduces the total number of coins.\n\nSo, perhaps the critical values are around the transitions where the remainder after using quarters would require a lot of pennies, but using an extra dime (or more) could cover that remainder with fewer coins.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nSuppose we have N. Let’s say we use k quarters. Then the remaining amount is R = N - 25k. For the greedy algorithm, k is as large as possible, i.e., k = floor(N / 25). Then R = N - 25k. Then, for R, we use as many dimes as possible: m = floor(R / 10), and then pennies: p = R - 10m. Total coins: k + m + p.\n\nAn alternative approach would be to use k' quarters, where k' < k, and then more dimes and pennies. Let's see if such a k' exists where (k - k') quarters removed can be compensated by adding dimes and pennies such that the total coins decrease.\n\nEach quarter removed gives back 25 cents. To compensate, we need to add coins summing to 25 cents. The question is, can we add dimes and pennies such that the number of coins added is less than the number of quarters removed? Since each quarter is 1 coin, removing 1 quarter gives us a \"budget\" of 1 fewer coin. So, to maintain the same total, we need to add coins summing to 25 cents using at most 0 coins (which is impossible). Therefore, actually, if we remove 1 quarter, we need to add 25 cents using coins, but each coin added adds to the coin count. Therefore, removing 1 quarter (saving 1 coin) and adding 25 cents using dimes and pennies would require at least 3 coins (2 dimes and 5 pennies: 25 = 2*10 + 5*1, which is 7 coins, but wait, 2 dimes and 5 pennies is 7 coins, which is worse than 1 quarter. Wait, that's not helpful. Wait, maybe another combination?\n\nWait, 25 cents can be made with 25 pennies (25 coins), 2 dimes and 5 pennies (7 coins), or 1 dime and 15 pennies (16 coins). None of these are better than 1 quarter. So, removing a quarter and replacing it with any combination of dimes and pennies would require more coins, which would be worse. Therefore, perhaps removing quarters is not beneficial.",
    "Wait, but in the example of 42 cents, removing a quarter allows replacing it with dimes. Wait, 42 cents: greedy uses 1 quarter, 1 dime, 7 pennies. Total coins: 1 + 1 + 7 = 9. The optimal is 4 dimes and 2 pennies: 6 coins. So, here, instead of using 1 quarter and 1 dime (total 2 coins covering 35 cents), they used 4 dimes (4 coins covering 40 cents). Wait, but that's adding 3 more dimes instead of a quarter and a dime. Wait, how does that work?",
    "Wait, maybe the problem arises when the remainder after using quarters is such that using an extra dime (or more) instead of pennies can save coins.\n\nWait, let's take another example. Suppose N = 30. Greedy would be 1 quarter, 0 dimes, 5 pennies. Total coins: 1 + 0 + 5 = 6. Alternatively, 3 dimes: 3 coins. So, here, the greedy algorithm is not optimal. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the coins available are 1, 10, 25. So, 30 cents: greedy is 25 + 5*1 = 6 coins. Optimal is 3*10 = 3 coins. So, indeed, greedy fails here.",
    "Wait, but why didn't the greedy algorithm pick dimes? Because after using the quarter, the remaining 5 cents can't be a dime. So, the greedy algorithm picks the largest coin possible at each step. So, 25 is picked first, then the remaining 5 can't take a dime, so pennies. But the optimal is to use three dimes. So, here, the problem is that the remainder after using quarters is less than 10, so you have to use pennies. But if instead, you had not used the quarter, you could use more dimes.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is when the remainder after using quarters is between 0 and 10, but if you instead reduce the number of quarters by 1, the new remainder becomes 25 + original remainder, which can be covered by dimes and pennies with fewer coins.\n\nWait, let's formalize this.\n\nSuppose N = 25k + r, where 0 ≤ r < 25. The greedy algorithm uses k quarters, m = floor(r / 10) dimes, and p = r - 10m pennies. Total coins: k + m + p.\n\nIf instead, we use k - 1 quarters, then the remaining amount is 25 + r. Then, we can use m' = floor((25 + r)/10) dimes and p' = (25 + r) - 10m' pennies. The total coins would be (k - 1) + m' + p'. If this total is less than k + m + p, then the greedy algorithm is not optimal.\n\nSo, the difference in coins is: [ (k - 1) + m' + p' ] vs. [ k + m + p ]\n\nWhich simplifies to: (m' + p' - 1) vs. (m + p)\n\nSo, if (m' + p' - 1) < (m + p), then the alternative is better.\n\nTherefore, the condition for the greedy algorithm to fail is:\n\nm' + p' - 1 < m + p\n\nBut m + p = floor(r / 10) + (r - 10*floor(r / 10)) = r // 10 + r % 10 = same as r, since r //10 + r%10 = floor(r /10) + (r -10*floor(r /10)) = r. Wait, no:\n\nWait, m = floor(r /10), p = r -10m. So, m + p = floor(r /10) + (r -10*floor(r /10)) = r - 9*floor(r /10). Wait, no:\n\nWait, if r = 10a + b, where 0 ≤ b <10, then m = a, p = b. So m + p = a + b. But r = 10a + b, so a = floor(r /10), b = r %10. So, m + p = floor(r /10) + r %10.\n\nSimilarly, for the alternative approach: remaining amount is 25 + r. Let’s denote s = 25 + r. Then m' = floor(s /10), p' = s %10. So, m' + p' = floor(s /10) + s %10.\n\nSo, the condition becomes:\n\nfloor(s /10) + s %10 -1 < floor(r /10) + r %10\n\nBut s = 25 + r. Let's write s =25 + r. Then:\n\nfloor((25 + r)/10) + (25 + r)%10 -1 < floor(r /10) + r%10\n\nLet’s compute left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS):\n\nLet’s denote r =10a + b, where a = floor(r /10), b = r%10. Then s =25 +10a + b.\n\nSo, s =25 +10a + b =10*(a +2) + (5 + b). If 5 + b <10, then floor(s /10) =a +2, and s%10 =5 + b. If 5 + b ≥10, then floor(s /10)=a +3, and s%10 =5 + b -10 = b -5.\n\nSo, two cases:\n\nCase 1: 5 + b <10 → b <5.\n\nThen, LHS = (a +2) + (5 + b) -1 = a + b +6 -1 = a + b +5.\n\nRHS = a + b.\n\nThus, LHS = a + b +5, RHS = a + b → LHS - RHS =5. So, 5 <0? No. So in this case, LHS is greater than RHS by 5, so the condition is not met.\n\nCase 2: 5 + b ≥10 → b ≥5.\n\nThen, floor(s /10)=a +3, s%10 = b -5.\n\nThus, LHS = (a +3) + (b -5) -1 = a + b +3 -5 -1 = a + b -3.\n\nRHS = a + b.\n\nSo, LHS - RHS = -3. Therefore, LHS < RHS by 3. So, the condition becomes:\n\na + b -3 < a + b → -3 <0, which is always true.\n\nTherefore, in Case 2 (when b ≥5), the condition is satisfied. Therefore, whenever the remainder r after using k quarters has b ≥5 (i.e., r%10 ≥5), then using k-1 quarters and adjusting the dimes and pennies gives a better coin count.\n\nWait, but let's check with an example. Take N=30. Then N=25*1 +5. So, k=1, r=5. Here, r=5, which is 10a +b with a=0, b=5. So, b=5, which is Case 2. Then LHS = (0 +3) + (5 -5) -1 =3 +0 -1=2. RHS =0 +5=5. So, 2 <5, which is true. Therefore, the alternative approach uses (k-1)=0 quarters, m'= floor(30/10)=3, p'=0. Total coins:0 +3 +0=3, which is better than the greedy's 1 +0 +5=6.",
    "Another example: N=40. Greedy would be 1 quarter, 1 dime, 5 pennies: 1+1+5=7. Wait, no: 40=25*1 +15. Then, 15=10*1 +5. So, coins:1+1+5=7. Alternatively, using 0 quarters, 4 dimes: 4 coins. So, indeed, the alternative is better. Let's check the condition. r=15, which is a=1, b=5. So, s=25 +15=40. Then, floor(40/10)=4, s%10=0. So, LHS=4 +0 -1=3. RHS=1 +5=6. So, 3<6, which is true. Therefore, the alternative is better.\n\nWait, but here, r=15, which is 10*1 +5. So, a=1, b=5. So, according to Case 2, LHS= (1 +3) + (5 -5) -1=4 +0 -1=3. RHS=1 +5=6. So, 3<6. Hence, condition holds.\n\nAnother example: N=25. Greedy is 1 quarter. Alternative is 0 quarters, 2 dimes and 5 pennies (25=2*10 +5*1). But that's 7 coins, which is worse. Wait, here, r=0. So, a=0, b=0. Then s=25 +0=25. floor(25/10)=2, s%10=5. So, LHS=2 +5 -1=6. RHS=0 +0=0. So, 6 <0? No. Therefore, condition not met. So, greedy is better.",
    "Wait, but if N=25, the greedy uses 1 coin. Any alternative would need to sum to 25 without quarters. The minimal coins would be 2 dimes and 5 pennies (7 coins), which is worse. So, indeed, greedy is optimal here.\n\nAnother example: N=35. Greedy: 1 quarter, 1 dime, 0 pennies. Total coins:1+1=2. Alternatively, 3 dimes and 1 nickel, but we don't have nickels. So, the alternative would be 35 pennies (35 coins), or 3*10 +5*1=8 coins. So, greedy is better. Let's check the condition. N=35=25*1 +10. So, r=10. Then, r=10a +b, a=1, b=0. Then s=25 +10=35. floor(35/10)=3, s%10=5. LHS=3 +5 -1=7. RHS=1 +0=1. So, 7 <1? No. So, condition not met. So, greedy is optimal.",
    "Wait, but if N=35, greedy uses 1 quarter and 1 dime: 2 coins. Any alternative would have to use 3 dimes and 5 pennies (8 coins) or 35 pennies. So, indeed, greedy is optimal.",
    "Wait, but here r=10, so b=0. So, Case 1. Then LHS= a + b +5=1 +0 +5=6. RHS=1 +0=1. So, 6 <1? No. Therefore, condition not met.\n\nSo, summarizing: The condition where the greedy algorithm fails is when, after using k quarters, the remainder r has r%10 ≥5. Then, using k-1 quarters and adjusting the remaining amount (25 + r) into dimes and pennies gives a better coin count.\n\nTherefore, for each N, if when you write N =25k + r (0 ≤ r <25), and r%10 ≥5, then the greedy algorithm is not optimal. Otherwise, it is optimal.",
    "Wait, but let's verify this with N=42. N=25*1 +17. So, r=17. Then, r%10=7 ≥5. So, according to the condition, greedy is not optimal. Which matches the example. Then, N=30: r=5, r%10=5, so greedy is not optimal. N=40: r=15, r%10=5, greedy not optimal. N=25: r=0, r%10=0 <5, greedy optimal. N=35: r=10, r%10=0 <5, greedy optimal. N=31: r=6, r%10=6 ≥5, greedy not optimal. Let's check N=31. Greedy: 1 quarter, 0 dimes, 6 pennies. Total coins:1+0+6=7. Alternative: 0 quarters, 3 dimes, 1 penny. Total coins:3+1=4. So, indeed, better. So, the condition holds.\n\nTherefore, the rule seems to be: For N =25k + r, where 0 ≤ r <25, if r%10 ≥5, then the greedy algorithm is not optimal; otherwise, it is optimal.\n\nTherefore, the values of N where the greedy algorithm is optimal are those where, when divided by 25, the remainder r has r%10 <5. That is, the last digit of r is less than 5.\n\nBut r is between 0 and 24. So, r can be from 0 to24. For each r, r%10 is the units digit. So, for r in 0-24, the possible r%10 digits are 0-9, but since r <25, the possible r%10 are 0-9 for r=0-9, and 0-4 for r=10-14, 10-14%10=0-4, and r=15-24%10=5-4. Wait, actually, r from 0-24:\n\nr=0: 0\n\nr=1:1\n\n...\n\nr=9:9\n\nr=10:0\n\nr=11:1\n\n...\n\nr=14:4\n\nr=15:5\n\nr=16:6\n\n...\n\nr=19:9\n\nr=20:0\n\nr=21:1\n\n...\n\nr=24:4\n\nSo, for r=0-24, r%10 cycles every 10. So, in r=0-24, the units digits are 0-4 repeated twice, and then 5-9 once. Wait:\n\nWait, r=0-9: units digits 0-9\n\nr=10-19: units digits 0-9\n\nBut wait, r=10 is 10, which is 0 mod10\n\nr=11:1\n\n...\n\nr=19:9\n\nr=20:0\n\n...\n\nr=24:4\n\nSo, actually, r=0-24:\n\nunits digits:\n\n0 (r=0,10,20)\n\n1 (r=1,11,21)\n\n2 (r=2,12,22)\n\n3 (r=3,13,23)\n\n4 (r=4,14,24)\n\n5 (r=5,15)\n\n6 (r=6,16)\n\n7 (r=7,17)\n\n8 (r=8,18)\n\n9 (r=9,19)",

So, for r where the units digit is less than5, i.e., digits 0,1,2,3,4. So, for each r in 0-24, if r%10 is 0-4, then greedy is optimal; otherwise, not.\n\nBut in r=0-24, how many r have r%10 <5?\n\nThey are:\n\nFor digits 0: r=0,10,20\n\nDigits1:1,11,21\n\nDigits2:2,12,22\n\nDigits3:3,13,23\n\nDigits4:4,14,24\n\nTotal: 5 digits (0-4), each appearing 3 times: 5*3=15 values of r where greedy is optimal.\n\nSimilarly, digits5-9: each appears 2 times (r=5,15;6,16;7,17;8,18;9,19): 5 digits *2=10 values of r where greedy is not optimal.",
    "But wait, total r from0-24 is25. 15+10=25, correct.\n\nTherefore, for each k (number of quarters), the remainder r can be0-24. For 15 of these r, greedy is optimal; for 10, it's not.",
    "But wait, this is only when we consider replacing 1 quarter. What if replacing more than 1 quarter could lead to a better result?",
    "For example, suppose N=80. Greedy:3 quarters, 0 dimes, 5 pennies. Total coins:3+0+5=8. Alternatively, 8 dimes:8 coins. Same number. So, same coins. Wait, but 80=3*25 +5. So, r=5. According to our previous condition, r%10=5 ≥5, so greedy is not optimal. But here, replacing 3 quarters with 8 dimes gives same number of coins. So, it's not strictly better. Therefore, perhaps our condition is not entirely accurate.",
    "Wait, but in the problem statement, the greedy algorithm succeeds if no other collection uses strictly fewer coins. So, if there's a tie, the greedy still succeeds. Therefore, in the case where alternative has same number of coins, greedy is still considered successful.\n\nTherefore, in the example N=80, greedy uses8 coins, alternative also uses8 coins. Therefore, greedy succeeds.\n\nBut according to our previous analysis, N=80=3*25 +5. r=5, which has r%10=5 ≥5. Therefore, according to the condition, the alternative approach would have coins: (k-1) + m' + p' =2 + floor(30/10) + (30%10)=2 +3 +0=5. Wait, no:\n\nWait, N=80.

So, why didn't my previous calculation catch this?\n\nAh, because when we remove k'=1 quarter, the remaining amount is25 + r=25 +5=30. Then, m'=floor(30/10)=3, p'=0. So, coins used: (k -1) + m' + p' =2 +3 +0=5, which is less than8. Therefore, the condition holds.",
    "Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, when r%10 ≥5, the condition holds. For N=80, r=5, which is r%10=5 ≥5. Therefore, the condition says greedy is not optimal, which matches reality.\n\nBut in my previous example where N=80, replacing 3 quarters with2 quarters and3 dimes gives5 coins, which is better. So, the condition correctly identifies that.",
    "Wait, but earlier when I thought of N=80 and replacing all quarters with dimes (8 dimes), which is same coins as greedy, but actually, replacing some quarters with dimes gives better result.\n\nSo, the key is that even if replacing multiple quarters can lead to better results, the condition where r%10 ≥5 captures that replacing at least one quarter would help.\n\nTherefore, the general rule is: For any N, if after using k quarters, the remainder r has a units digit (r%10) ≥5, then using k-1 quarters and adjusting the remaining 25 +r into dimes and pennies gives a better result. If the units digit is <5, then greedy is optimal.\n\nTherefore, to count the number of N from1 to1000 where the greedy algorithm is optimal, we need to count the numbers N where, when expressed as N=25k +r (0 ≤r <25), the remainder r has r%10 <5.\n\nBut note that N=0 is excluded since N starts from1.\n\nSo, for each N from1 to1000, decompose N into25k +r, check if r%10 <5. If yes, count it.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting numbers N in1-1000 such that r =N mod25, and r%10 <5.",
    "Alternatively, for each residue r modulo25, from0 to24, we can determine how many numbers N in1-1000 have N ≡r mod25 and r%10 <5.\n\nThen sum over all such r.\n\nBut since residues modulo25 repeat every25 numbers, we can compute for each r in0-24, how many times r occurs in1-1000, and then multiply by whether r%10 <5.",

So, numbers from1 to1000 consist of40 complete blocks of25 numbers each:1-25,26-50,...,976-1000. Wait, 25*40=1000, so yes.",
    "Therefore, each residue r from0 to24 occurs exactly40 times in the range1-1000. Wait, but residue0 occurs at25,50,...,1000. So, residue0 occurs40 times (since1000 is included). But our range is1-1000. So, residue0 occurs40 times (25,50,...,1000). The other residues1-24 occur40 times each as well: for example, residue1 occurs at1,26,51,...,976+1=977; next would be1001, which is outside. So, residue1 occurs40 times.\n\nTherefore, total residues0-24 each occur40 times in1-1000.\n\nWait, but residue0 occurs at25,50,...,1000: which is40 numbers. Residues1-24 occur from1-24,26-49,...,976-999. Each residue1-24 occurs exactly40 times.\n\nTherefore, for each residue r in0-24:\n\nIf r=0: check if0%10 <5 →0<5: yes.

Similarly, N=50:2 quarters. Optimal. So, yes, these are correctly counted.\n\nTherefore, residues r=0-24:\n\nFor each r, check if r%10 <5. If yes, then all numbers ≡r mod25 in1-1000 are counted.\n\nNumber of such r where r%10 <5:\n\nFrom earlier analysis, residues r where r%10 <5 are:\n\nFor r=0:0%10=0<5: yes\n\nr=1:1<5: yes\n\nr=2:yes\n\nr=3:yes\n\nr=4:yes\n\nr=10:10%10=0<5:yes\n\nr=11:1<5:yes\n\nr=12:2<5:yes\n\nr=13:3<5:yes\n\nr=14:4<5:yes\n\nr=20:20%10=0<5:yes\n\nr=21:1<5:yes\n\nr=22:2<5:yes\n\nr=23:3<5:yes\n\nr=24:4<5:yes\n\nAdditionally, r=5-9 and15-19:\n\nr=5:5%10=5≥5:no\n\nr=6:6≥5:no\n\n...\n\nr=9:9≥5:no\n\nr=15:15%10=5≥5:no\n\n...\n\nr=19:19%10=9≥5:no\n\nSimilarly, r=5-9 and15-19: total10 residues where r%10 ≥5.\n\nTherefore, residues where r%10 <5 are:\n\nr=0,1,2,3,4,10,11,12,13,14,20,21,22,23,24. Total15 residues.\n\nEach of these15 residues occurs40 times in1-1000. Therefore, total numbers N where greedy succeeds is15*40=600.",

Wait, but according to our condition, greedy should fail here. Wait, no: for N=5, since there are no nickels or dimes that can help. So, greedy is forced to use5 pennies. There's no alternative. So, greedy is optimal here. But according to our previous analysis, residues r=5 would be excluded. But here, N=5: r=5, which is r%10=5≥5, so according to our condition, the greedy algorithm should not be optimal. But in reality, it is optimal. Contradiction.\n\nWait, so there's a mistake in our reasoning.\n\nWait, let's revisit the earlier logic. The condition was: if after using k quarters, the remainder r has r%10 ≥5, then using k-1 quarters gives a better result. But in N=5, we can't use any quarters (since 25>5). So, k=0. Then, remainder r=5. Then, s=25 +5=30. So, m'=floor(30/10)=3, p'=0. Total coins: (k -1) + m' + p' = -1 +3 +0=2. But coins can't be negative. So, this approach isn't valid when k=0.\n\nAh! So, the earlier analysis assumes that k ≥1, so that we can reduce k by1. But when k=0 (i.e., N <25), then we can't reduce k further. Therefore, the condition applies only when k ≥1.",
    "Therefore, for N <25 (k=0), the remainder r=N. So, in this case, the greedy algorithm for N <25 is: use as many dimes as possible, then pennies. So, for N <25, the greedy algorithm is optimal if and only if there's no way to use fewer coins by using fewer dimes and more pennies? Wait, no. Wait, for N <25, the denominations are1 and10. So, the greedy algorithm would use floor(N/10) dimes and N%10 pennies. The minimal number of coins is indeed floor(N/10) + N%10, since using more dimes reduces the number of coins. For example, N=15:1 dime and5 pennies (6 coins) vs.15 pennies (15 coins). So, greedy is optimal here. Wait, but according to our earlier condition, when N=15 (r=15, since k=0), r%10=5≥5, which would suggest greedy is not optimal. But in reality, for N=15, greedy uses1 dime and5 pennies (6 coins). Alternatively, using0 dimes and15 pennies (15 coins), which is worse. So, greedy is optimal here. Therefore, our earlier analysis is flawed.\n\nThe problem arises because when k=0 (N <25), the alternative approach of using k-1 quarters is impossible (since k=0). Therefore, the earlier logic only applies when k ≥1, i.e., N ≥25. For N <25, the remainder r=N, and the greedy algorithm for dimes and pennies is actually optimal, because there's no way to use quarters. Therefore, for N <25, the greedy algorithm (using dimes and pennies) is always optimal, regardless of r%10.\n\nWait, but in the example N=15, which is less than25, the greedy algorithm uses1 dime and5 pennies (6 coins). But if we were allowed to use quarters, which we aren't, since N=15 <25. So, in this case, the minimal coins is6, which is the same as greedy. So, greedy is optimal. Similarly, N=5:5 pennies, which is optimal. N=10:1 dime, optimal. N=20:2 dimes, optimal. N=24:2 dimes and4 pennies, which is6 coins. Optimal.",
    "Therefore, for N <25, the greedy algorithm (which uses as many dimes as possible, then pennies) is always optimal. Therefore, for N <25, all N should be counted as successes for the greedy algorithm. But according to our previous count, residues r=0-24 where r%10 <5 are15 residues, each occurring40 times. But residues r=0-24 correspond to N=1-24 (when k=0) and N=25-1000 (k≥1). Wait, no. For N=1-24, r=N. For N=25-49, r=N-25; etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is that when k=0 (N <25), the remainder r=N. So, for these N, the condition r%10 <5 is not necessary, because there's no alternative with quarters. Therefore, for N <25, all N should be counted as successes, regardless of r%10.\n\nTherefore, our earlier conclusion that there are15 residues r where r%10 <5, each occurring40 times, leading to15*40=600 numbers is incorrect because it includes N=25-1000 where r=0-24, but for N=1-24, even if r%10 ≥5, they are still optimal because there's no way to use quarters.\n\nTherefore, we need to adjust our calculation.\n\nLet’s split the problem into two parts:\n\n1. N from1 to24 (k=0): All these N are automatically optimal because you can't use quarters. So, for these24 numbers, greedy succeeds.\n\n2. N from25 to1000 (k≥1): For these, the remainder r=N -25k (0 ≤r <25). For these N, greedy succeeds if r%10 <5. So, residues r=0-24 where r%10 <5:15 residues. Each residue occurs floor((1000 - r)/25) times? Wait, no. Wait, for N from25 to1000, how many times does each residue r=0-24 occur?\n\nSince25 to1000 is976 numbers (1000 -24=976). Since976=39*25 +1. Wait,25*39=975, so25 to975 is39*25=975 numbers. Then976 to1000 is25 numbers. Wait, no:\n\nWait, N=25 to1000 inclusive: total numbers=1000 -24=976.

Therefore, there's a discrepancy of14 numbers.\n\nThe error arises because residue0 is counted40 times (25,50,...,1000). But1000 is part of residue0 and is included in the blocks. However, when we calculated per residue, we considered residues1-4,10-14,20-24 as each occurring39 times in25-1000. But in reality, each block contributes15 numbers, and40 blocks give600 numbers. Therefore, the correct count from25-1000 is600 numbers.\n\nBut why does the residue-based approach give586? Because it assumes that residues1-4,10-14,20-24 each occur39 times in25-1000. But in reality, each block contributes15 numbers, and40 blocks give600 numbers, which must be correct.\n\nTherefore, the mistake was in the residue-based calculation. The correct approach is:\n\nTotal numbers from25-1000:976 numbers.\n\nEach block of25 numbers contributes15 counted numbers. There are40 blocks (25-49,...,1000).

Wait, let's check with N=42.\n\nN=42 is in25-49 block. r=42-25=17. r=17, r%10=7≥5. Therefore, not counted. So, N=42 is excluded. Which matches the example.\n\nSimilarly, N=30:r=5, excluded.\n\nN=35:r=10, included.\n\nSo, the count seems correct. But according to this, total values of N where greedy succeeds is624.",
    "But wait, the problem asks for values between1 and1000 inclusive. So,624.\n\nBut I need to verify this with another method.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nFor each N from1 to1000, determine if the greedy algorithm is optimal.\n\nThe greedy algorithm is optimal if and only if there's no way to replace some number of quarters with dimes and pennies to reduce the total coin count.\n\nAs established earlier, this happens when the remainder after using the maximum quarters has r%10 <5.\n\nBut for N <25, the remainder is N itself, and since we can't use quarters, the greedy algorithm for dimes and pennies is always optimal. Therefore, all N from1 to24 are successes.\n\nFor N ≥25, we need to check if r%10 <5, where r =N -25k, k=floor(N/25).\n\nTherefore, total successes:\n\n- N=1-24:24 numbers.\n\n- N=25-1000: numbers where r%10 <5.

Total coins40. Optimal. So, counted.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example:N=999.\n\n999=39*25 +24. r=24. r%10=4<5. So, counted. Greedy uses39 quarters,2 dimes,4 pennies. Total coins39+2+4=45. Is there a better combination? Let's see:39 quarters is975. Remainder24. 24=2*10 +4. Total coins39+2+4=45. Alternatively,38 quarters=950. Remainder49. 49=4*10 +9. Total coins38+4+9=51. Worse.

Worse.\n\nSo, these examples confirm that when r%10 <5, greedy is optimal.\n\nTherefore, the total number of successes is624.",
    "But wait, the answer is624? But when I think about the original example, N=42 is excluded, N=30 is excluded, etc. So,624 seems plausible.\n\nBut I need to check if there's any overlap or mistake in the calculation.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the answer is different. Wait, let me check online or think differently.",
    "Wait, another way to think about it: the values for which the greedy algorithm fails are those where there's a number of dimes and pennies that can replace a quarter and some coins to reduce the total count.\n\nSpecifically, replacing a quarter (25 cents) with two dimes and five pennies (25 cents) uses2+5=7 coins instead of1 quarter. But this is worse. However, in the example of N=30, replacing a quarter (25) with three dimes (30) uses3 coins instead of1 quarter and5 pennies (6 coins). So, the saving comes from avoiding the pennies by not using the quarter.\n\nSo, the key is when the remainder after using quarters requires enough pennies that replacing a quarter with dimes eliminates the need for those pennies.\n\nThe amount saved is the number of pennies you would have used minus the number of dimes added.\n\nIn the example of N=30:\n\nGreedy:1 quarter,5 pennies (6 coins).\n\nAlternative:3 dimes (3 coins).\n\nSavings:6 -3=3 coins.\n\nThis happens because by removing1 quarter (-1 coin), you add3 dimes (+3 coins), but eliminate5 pennies (-5 coins). Net change:-1 +3 -5=-3 coins. So total coins saved:3.\n\nSimilarly, for N=42:\n\nGreedy:1 quarter,1 dime,7 pennies (9 coins).\n\nAlternative:4 dimes,2 pennies (6 coins).\n\nSavings:9 -6=3 coins.\n\nNet change from removing1 quarter (-1), adding3 dimes (+3), removing1 dime (-1), and removing7 pennies (-7), adding2 pennies (+2). Total:-1 +3 -1 -7 +2=-4. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the alternative approach doesn't necessarily have to follow removing a quarter and adjusting, but can be a different combination.\n\nBut the key seems to be when the remainder after using quarters has r%10 ≥5, which allows replacing a quarter with dimes and pennies in such a way that the total coins are reduced.\n\nTherefore, the initial conclusion that there are624 values where greedy succeeds seems plausible.\n\nBut let's verify with another example.\n\nTake N=5. Greedy is5 pennies. Optimal. So counted.\n\nN=10. Greedy is1 dime. Optimal. Counted.\n\nN=15. Greedy is1 dime,5 pennies. Optimal. Counted.\n\nN=20. Greedy is2 dimes. Optimal. Counted.\n\nN=25.

Greedy is1 quarter,1 dime,5 pennies. Not optimal. Not counted.\n\nN=45. Greedy is1 quarter,2 dimes. Optimal. Counted.\n\nN=50. Greedy is2 quarters. Optimal. Counted.\n\nSo, in the first few numbers:\n\nCounted:1-24,25,26,27,28,29,35,36,37,38,39,45,46,47,48,49,...\n\nSo, up toN=49, counted numbers are1-24 (24),25 (1),26-29 (4),35-39 (5),45-49 (5). Total24+1+4+5+5=39. Wait, but per block25-49, counted numbers are15. So,25-49:15 counted. Plus1-24:24 counted. Total39. But25-49 is25 numbers, but counted15.",
    "Wait, perhaps my initial assumption that all N=1-24 are counted is incorrect. Because residues r=5-9 and15-19 in N=1-24 would have r%10 ≥5, but since they can't use quarters, they are still counted.",
    "Wait, for N=5 (r=5), which is in1-24. Since N=5 <25, greedy uses0 quarters,0 dimes,5 pennies. Optimal. So, counted.\n\nSimilarly, N=15:0 quarters,1 dime,5 pennies. Optimal. So, counted.\n\nTherefore, even though r%10 ≥5 for N=5,15, etc., in1-24, they are still counted because there's no alternative. Therefore, the initial statement that all N=1-24 are counted is correct.\n\nTherefore, total counted numbers:\n\n1-24:24\n\n25-1000:15 per block *40 blocks=600\n\nTotal:624.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be624.\n\nBut I recall that in some resources, this problem is similar to the classic coin change problem, and the number of failures is76, leading to1000 -76=924. But I might be misremembering.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps my analysis is incorrect.",
    "Wait, let's think differently. Maybe the number of N where greedy fails is equal to the number of times there's a residue r >=5 and r%10 >=5 in the range25-1000.\n\nBut according to our analysis, for N >=25, the failures are when r%10 >=5. There are10 residues per block where this happens (r=5-9,15-19). Each block of25 has10 such residues. Therefore,40 blocks *10=400 failures. But1000-24=976 numbers from25-1000.976 -600=376. Not matching.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the number of failures is40*10=400. But624 successes, failures=1000 -624=376. Not matching.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is indeed624, based on the block analysis. But I need to confirm.",
    "Alternatively, let's compute the number of N from1 to1000 where r%10 <5 or N <25.\n\nTotal numbers where r%10 <5:\n\nFor each residue r=0-24:\n\nIf r%10 <5, then count the number of N≡r mod25 in1-1000.\n\nAs established earlier, each residue r=0-24 occurs40 times.\n\nResidues where r%10 <5:15 residues.\n\nTherefore,15*40=600 numbers.\n\nBut this includes N=0, which is not in our range. Since r=0 occurs at25,50,...,1000, which are all in1-1000. So,15*40=600 numbers from1-1000 where r%10 <5.\n\nBut N=1-24: residues r=1-24. Among these, residues r=1-24 where r%10 <5 are:\n\nr=1-4,10-14,20-24. But wait, N=1-24:\n\nr=1-4:4 numbers\n\nr=5-9:5 numbers\n\nr=10-14:5 numbers\n\nr=15-19:5 numbers\n\nr=20-24:5 numbers",
    "But N=1-24 can't have r=10-14 or15-19 or20-24 beyond N=24. Wait, N=1-24:\n\nr=1-24.\n\nSo, residues r=1-24:\n\nr%10 <5:\n\nr=1-4,10-14,20-24.\n\nBut in N=1-24:\n\nr=1-4:4 numbers\n\nr=10-14: N=10-14:5 numbers\n\nr=20-24:N=20-24:5 numbers\n\nTotal in1-24:4+5+5=14 numbers where r%10 <5.",
    "But wait, N=1-24:\n\nr=1-24.\n\nr%10 <5:\n\nr=1-4:4 numbers (N=1-4)\n\nr=10-14:5 numbers (N=10-14)\n\nr=20-24:5 numbers (N=20-24)\n\nTotal:14 numbers.\n\nBut earlier we thought all N=1-24 are counted. But according to this, only14 of them have r%10 <5. But in reality, for N=1-24, even if r%10 >=5, like N=5,6,...,9,15,...,19, the greedy algorithm is still optimal because you can't use quarters. Therefore, all N=1-24 should be counted, regardless of r%10.\n\nTherefore, the correct calculation is:\n\nTotal successes:\n\n- N=1-24:24 numbers.\n\n- N=25-1000: numbers where r%10 <5. As each residue r=0-24 occurs40 times, and15 of them have r%10 <5, total15*40=600 numbers.\n\nTotal:24+600=624.\n\nTherefore, the answer is624.\n\nBut to confirm, let's consider the following:\n\nFor N from1 to1000:\n\n- If N <25:24 numbers, all counted.\n\n- If N >=25:\n\nCheck if N mod25 has a remainder r where r%10 <5. If yes, counted.\n\nNumber of such N >=25:15 residues *40=600.\n\nTotal:24+600=624.\n\nTherefore, the number of values of N between1 and1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds is624.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{624}\n"
