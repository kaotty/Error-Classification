      "content": "\n\nOkay, let's see. I have this sequence defined by x₁ = 25/11, and then each subsequent term is given by x_{k+1} = (1/3)(x_k + 1/x_k - 1). And I need to find x_{2025} expressed as m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n mod 1000. Hmm. Alright, let's start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the sequence starts at 25/11, which is a bit more than 2, since 25/11 ≈ 2.27. Then each term is calculated by taking the previous term, adding 1 over that term, subtracting 1, and then multiplying by 1/3. So the recursion is x_{k+1} = (x_k + 1/x_k - 1)/3. Interesting. Let me try computing the first few terms manually to see if there's a pattern or if it converges to something.\n\nStarting with x₁ = 25/11 ≈ 2.2727.\n\nCompute x₂: (25/11 + 1/(25/11) - 1)/3. Let's compute each part:\n\n1/(25/11) = 11/25. So:\n\nx₂ = (25/11 + 11/25 - 1)/3.\n\nFirst, compute 25/11 ≈ 2.2727, 11/25 = 0.44, and subtract 1. So:\n\n25/11 - 1 = 25/11 - 11/11 = 14/11 ≈ 1.2727. Then add 11/25: 14/11 + 11/25. Let's find a common denominator here. 14/11 is 350/275, and 11/25 is 121/275. So total is 350 + 121 = 471/275. Then divide by 3: 471/275 /3 = 471/(275*3) = 471/825. Simplify that fraction. Let's see, 471 ÷ 3 = 157, 825 ÷3=275. So x₂ = 157/275 ≈ 0.5709.\n\nHmm, that's a big drop from 2.27 to 0.57. Let's compute x₃ next.\n\nx₃ = (157/275 + 1/(157/275) - 1)/3.\n\nFirst, compute 1/(157/275) = 275/157 ≈ 1.7516. Then:\n\n157/275 + 275/157 - 1. Let's compute each term:\n\n157/275 ≈ 0.5709, 275/157 ≈ 1.7516, so adding them gives ≈ 0.5709 + 1.7516 ≈ 2.3225. Subtract 1: ≈ 1.3225. Then divide by 3: ≈ 0.4408. Let's compute exactly.\n\nConvert to fractions:\n\n157/275 + 275/157 - 1.\n\nFirst, find common denominator for 275 and 157. Since 275 = 5²×11, and 157 is prime (I think), so LCM is 275×157. Let's compute numerator:\n\n157×157 + 275×275 - 275×157.\n\nWait, maybe there's a smarter way. Let's compute:\n\n157/275 + 275/157 = (157² + 275²)/(275×157). Then subtract 1: (157² + 275² - 275×157)/(275×157).\n\nCompute numerator: Let's see, 157² + 275² - 275×157. Let's factor this expression. Wait, maybe recognize this as part of a formula. Let me recall that a² + b² - ab = (a² + b² - ab). Not sure if that factors. Alternatively, compute numerically:\n\n157² = 24649, 275² = 75625, 275×157 = 43175.\n\nSo numerator: 24649 + 75625 - 43175 = (24649 + 75625) = 100274 - 43175 = 57099. So numerator is 57099, denominator is 275×157 = 43175. So the numerator is 57099/43175 - 1? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, the entire expression is (157/275 + 275/157 - 1) = (157² + 275² - 275×157)/(275×157) = 57099/43175. Then x₃ = (57099/43175)/3 = 57099/(43175×3) = 57099/129525. Simplify this fraction.\n\nLet's check GCD of numerator and denominator. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 3 first: 57099 ÷3=19033, 129525 ÷3=43175. Now check GCD(19033, 43175). Let's use Euclidean algorithm.\n\n43175 ÷19033= 2×19033=38066, remainder 43175-38066=5109.\n\nNow GCD(19033,5109). 19033 ÷5109=3×5109=15327, remainder 19033-15327=3706.\n\nGCD(5109,3706). 5109 ÷3706=1×3706, remainder 5109-3706=1403.\n\nGCD(3706,1403). 3706 ÷1403=2×1403=2806, remainder 3706-2806=900.\n\nGCD(1403,900). 1403 ÷900=1×900, remainder 503.\n\nGCD(900,503). 900 ÷503=1×503, remainder 397.\n\nGCD(503,397). 503 ÷397=1×397, remainder 106.\n\nGCD(397,106). 397 ÷106=3×106=318, remainder 79.\n\nGCD(106,79). 106 ÷79=1×79, remainder 27.\n\nGCD(79,27). 79 ÷27=2×27=54, remainder 25.\n\nGCD(27,25). 27 ÷25=1×25, remainder 2.\n\nGCD(25,2). 25 ÷2=12×2=24, remainder 1.\n\nGCD(2,1). GCD is 1. So GCD is 1. Therefore, 19033/43175 is reduced. So x₃ = 19033/43175 ≈ 0.4408.",

Let's suppose that the sequence converges to a fixed point L. Then L would satisfy L = (L + 1/L -1)/3. Multiply both sides by 3: 3L = L + 1/L -1. Rearranging: 3L - L +1 = 1/L => 2L +1 = 1/L. Multiply both sides by L: 2L² + L =1. So quadratic equation: 2L² + L -1 =0. Solving: L = [-1 ±√(1 +8)]/(4) = [-1 ±3]/4. So roots at (-1 +3)/4=0.5 and (-1 -3)/4=-1. Since the terms are positive, the fixed point would be 1/2. So maybe the sequence converges to 1/2. But does it actually converge? Let's see.\n\nLooking at the computed terms: x₁≈2.27, x₂≈0.57, x₃≈0.44, which is approaching 0.5. Let's compute x₄.\n\nx₃ = 19033/43175 ≈0.4408.\n\nCompute x₄ = (x₃ + 1/x₃ -1)/3.\n\nFirst, 1/x₃ ≈1/0.4408≈2.268. Then x₃ +1/x₃ ≈0.4408 +2.268≈2.7088. Subtract 1:≈1.7088. Divide by3≈0.5696.

      "content": "Similarly, x₅=(x₄ +1/x₄ -1)/3. This is getting too cumbersome. Clearly, manually computing terms isn't feasible here. The fractions are getting unwieldy, and there's no obvious pattern yet. So perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nLet me revisit the original recursion: x_{k+1} = (x_k + 1/x_k -1)/3. Maybe consider substituting variables or transforming the equation. Let's try multiplying both sides by 3:\n\n3x_{k+1} = x_k + 1/x_k -1.\n\nRearrange:\n\n3x_{k+1} +1 = x_k + 1/x_k.\n\nLet me denote y_k = x_k + 1/x_k. Then the equation becomes:\n\n3x_{k+1} +1 = y_k.\n\nBut also, y_k = x_k + 1/x_k. So we have:\n\ny_k = 3x_{k+1} +1.\n\nBut then, perhaps express y_{k} in terms of x_{k+1}, and relate y_{k+1} to x_{k+1} similarly.\n\nWait, y_{k+1} = x_{k+1} + 1/x_{k+1}.\n\nBut from above, y_k =3x_{k+1} +1. So x_{k+1} = (y_k -1)/3.\n\nTherefore, y_{k+1} = x_{k+1} +1/x_{k+1} = (y_k -1)/3 + 3/(y_k -1).\n\nSo we have a recursion for y_k:\n\ny_{k+1} = (y_k -1)/3 + 3/(y_k -1).\n\nThis seems like a more manageable recursion? Let's see.\n\nSo starting from x₁=25/11, compute y₁ =x₁ +1/x₁=25/11 +11/25= (625 +121)/275=746/275≈2.7127.

So y₂=100274/43175.\n\nThen y₂=100274/43175≈2.3225.\n\nThen compute y₃=(y₂ -1)/3 +3/(y₂ -1).\n\nCompute y₂ -1=100274/43175 -43175/43175=57099/43175.\n\nThen (y₂ -1)/3=57099/(43175×3)=57099/129525=19033/43175≈0.4408.\n\n3/(y₂ -1)=3/(57099/43175)=129525/57099=43175/19033≈2.268.\n\nSo y₃=19033/43175 +43175/19033≈0.4408 +2.268≈2.7088. Which matches previous computation where x₃≈0.4408 and y₃=x₃ +1/x₃≈0.4408 +2.268≈2.7088.\n\nSo this recursion for y_k is y_{k+1} = (y_k -1)/3 +3/(y_k -1). Let's see if we can find a pattern here.",

Then:\n\nx_{k+1} = ( (a_k/b_k)^2 +1 -a_k/b_k ) / (3a_k/b_k )\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by b_k²:\n\nx_{k+1} = (a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k ) / (3a_k b_k )\n\nSo x_{k+1} = (a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k ) / (3a_k b_k )\n\nTherefore, if x_k =a_k/b_k, then x_{k+1}= (a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k )/(3a_k b_k ). So we can represent x_{k+1} as a fraction where numerator is a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k and denominator is 3a_k b_k. Therefore, recursively, we can define:\n\na_{k+1} = a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k\n\nb_{k+1} =3a_k b_k\n\nWith a₁=25, b₁=11.\n\nTherefore, the sequence x_k =a_k /b_k, where a_k and b_k are defined by:\n\na_{k+1}=a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k\n\nb_{k+1}=3a_k b_k\n\nStarting with a₁=25, b₁=11.\n\nTherefore, perhaps we can compute a_k and b_k modulo 1000 to find m +n mod1000. However, since m and n are coprime, we need to compute a_{2025} and b_{2025}, reduce them to lowest terms, then sum m +n mod1000.\n\nBut computing a_{2025} and b_{2025} directly is impossible due to their size. However, perhaps we can find a pattern in a_k and b_k modulo 1000 or some other modulus.\n\nBut first, let's check if a_k and b_k are always coprime. Suppose that a_k and b_k are coprime. Then:\n\na_{k+1}=a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k\n\nb_{k+1}=3a_k b_k\n\nWe need to check if a_{k+1} and b_{k+1} are coprime.\n\nSuppose p is a prime dividing both a_{k+1} and b_{k+1}. Then p divides b_{k+1}=3a_k b_k. So p divides 3, a_k, or b_k. Also, p divides a_{k+1}=a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k.\n\nIf p divides a_k: Then since p divides a_{k+1}=a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k, and p divides a_k, then p divides b_k². But since a_k and b_k are coprime, p cannot divide b_k, contradiction. Similarly, if p divides b_k, then p divides a_k², again contradicting coprimality. Therefore, p must divide 3. So the only possible common divisor is 3.\n\nTherefore, gcd(a_{k+1},b_{k+1}) is either 1 or 3.\n\nCheck if 3 divides a_{k+1}:\n\nIf 3 divides a_{k+1}=a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k.\n\nIf a_k and b_k are not divisible by 3, then compute a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k mod3.\n\nLet’s suppose a_k ≡1 mod3, b_k≡1 mod3:\n\na_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k ≡1 +1 -1×1=1 mod3. Not divisible by3.\n\nSimilarly, a_k≡1, b_k≡2:\n\n1 +4 -2=3≡0 mod3.\n\nSimilarly, a_k≡2, b_k≡1:\n\n4 +1 -2=3≡0 mod3.\n\na_k≡2, b_k≡2:\n\n4 +4 -4=4≡1 mod3.\n\nTherefore, if a_k and b_k are not divisible by3, then a_{k+1}≡0 mod3 iff a_k and b_k are congruent to1 and2 or 2 and1 modulo3.\n\nBut starting with a₁=25≡1 mod3, b₁=11≡2 mod3. So a₁≡1, b₁≡2 mod3. Then a_{2}=a₁² +b₁² -a₁b₁=25² +11² -25×11=625 +121 -275=625+121=746-275=471. 471≡0 mod3. Indeed,471=3×157. So a₂=471, b₂=3×25×11=825.\n\ngcd(a₂,b₂)=gcd(471,825). As computed earlier, GCD is 3. So here, gcd(a₂,b₂)=3. Therefore, x₂=471/825=157/275 after dividing numerator and denominator by3.\n\nTherefore, the fractions x_k can be simplified by dividing by gcd(a_k,b_k), which is either1 or3. So when computing m/n as reduced fraction, m=a_k /gcd(a_k,b_k), n=b_k /gcd(a_k,b_k).\n\nTherefore, m +n= (a_k +b_k)/gcd(a_k,b_k). So to compute m +n mod1000, we need to compute (a_k +b_k)/gcd(a_k,b_k) mod1000.\n\nBut since gcd(a_k,b_k) is either1 or3, depending on whether a_k and b_k are congruent modulo3.\n\nBut tracking whether gcd(a_k,b_k) is1 or3 requires knowing whether a_k and b_k are divisible by3. However, perhaps we can find a pattern modulo some number where the sequence repeats.",

    "\n\nOkay, let's see. I have this sequence defined by x₁ = 25/11, and then each subsequent term is given by x_{k+1} = (1/3)(x_k + 1/x_k - 1). And I need to find x_{2025} expressed as m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n mod 1000. Hmm. Alright, let's start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the sequence starts at 25/11, which is a bit more than 2, since 25/11 ≈ 2.27. Then each term is calculated by taking the previous term, adding 1 over that term, subtracting 1, and then multiplying by 1/3. So the recursion is x_{k+1} = (x_k + 1/x_k - 1)/3. Interesting. Let me try computing the first few terms manually to see if there's a pattern or if it converges to something.\n\nStarting with x₁ = 25/11 ≈ 2.2727.\n\nCompute x₂: (25/11 + 1/(25/11) - 1)/3. Let's compute each part:\n\n1/(25/11) = 11/25. So:\n\nx₂ = (25/11 + 11/25 - 1)/3.\n\nFirst, compute 25/11 ≈ 2.2727, 11/25 = 0.44, and subtract 1. So:\n\n25/11 - 1 = 25/11 - 11/11 = 14/11 ≈ 1.2727. Then add 11/25: 14/11 + 11/25. Let's find a common denominator here. 14/11 is 350/275, and 11/25 is 121/275. So total is 350 + 121 = 471/275. Then divide by 3: 471/275 /3 = 471/(275*3) = 471/825. Simplify that fraction. Let's see, 471 ÷ 3 = 157, 825 ÷3=275. So x₂ = 157/275 ≈ 0.5709.\n\nHmm, that's a big drop from 2.27 to 0.57. Let's compute x₃ next.\n\nx₃ = (157/275 + 1/(157/275) - 1)/3.\n\nFirst, compute 1/(157/275) = 275/157 ≈ 1.7516. Then:\n\n157/275 + 275/157 - 1. Let's compute each term:\n\n157/275 ≈ 0.5709, 275/157 ≈ 1.7516, so adding them gives ≈ 0.5709 + 1.7516 ≈ 2.3225. Subtract 1: ≈ 1.3225. Then divide by 3: ≈ 0.4408. Let's compute exactly.\n\nConvert to fractions:\n\n157/275 + 275/157 - 1.\n\nFirst, find common denominator for 275 and 157. Since 275 = 5²×11, and 157 is prime (I think), so LCM is 275×157. Let's compute numerator:\n\n157×157 + 275×275 - 275×157.\n\nWait, maybe there's a smarter way. Let's compute:\n\n157/275 + 275/157 = (157² + 275²)/(275×157). Then subtract 1: (157² + 275² - 275×157)/(275×157).\n\nCompute numerator: Let's see, 157² + 275² - 275×157. Let's factor this expression. Wait, maybe recognize this as part of a formula. Let me recall that a² + b² - ab = (a² + b² - ab). Not sure if that factors. Alternatively, compute numerically:\n\n157² = 24649, 275² = 75625, 275×157 = 43175.\n\nSo numerator: 24649 + 75625 - 43175 = (24649 + 75625) = 100274 - 43175 = 57099. So numerator is 57099, denominator is 275×157 = 43175. So the numerator is 57099/43175 - 1? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, the entire expression is (157/275 + 275/157 - 1) = (157² + 275² - 275×157)/(275×157) = 57099/43175. Then x₃ = (57099/43175)/3 = 57099/(43175×3) = 57099/129525. Simplify this fraction.\n\nLet's check GCD of numerator and denominator. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 3 first: 57099 ÷3=19033, 129525 ÷3=43175. Now check GCD(19033, 43175). Let's use Euclidean algorithm.\n\n43175 ÷19033= 2×19033=38066, remainder 43175-38066=5109.\n\nNow GCD(19033,5109). 19033 ÷5109=3×5109=15327, remainder 19033-15327=3706.\n\nGCD(5109,3706). 5109 ÷3706=1×3706, remainder 5109-3706=1403.\n\nGCD(3706,1403). 3706 ÷1403=2×1403=2806, remainder 3706-2806=900.\n\nGCD(1403,900). 1403 ÷900=1×900, remainder 503.\n\nGCD(900,503). 900 ÷503=1×503, remainder 397.\n\nGCD(503,397). 503 ÷397=1×397, remainder 106.\n\nGCD(397,106). 397 ÷106=3×106=318, remainder 79.\n\nGCD(106,79). 106 ÷79=1×79, remainder 27.\n\nGCD(79,27). 79 ÷27=2×27=54, remainder 25.\n\nGCD(27,25). 27 ÷25=1×25, remainder 2.\n\nGCD(25,2). 25 ÷2=12×2=24, remainder 1.\n\nGCD(2,1). GCD is 1. So GCD is 1. Therefore, 19033/43175 is reduced. So x₃ = 19033/43175 ≈ 0.4408.",

    "Alternatively, maybe consider writing the recursion in terms of continued fractions or something else. Alternatively, perhaps look for fixed points.

Multiply both sides by L: 2L² + L =1. So quadratic equation: 2L² + L -1 =0. Solving: L = [-1 ±√(1 +8)]/(4) = [-1 ±3]/4. So roots at (-1 +3)/4=0.5 and (-1 -3)/4=-1. Since the terms are positive, the fixed point would be 1/2. So maybe the sequence converges to 1/2. But does it actually converge?

    "Alternatively, let's compute 19033² +43175² -43175×19033.",
    "Let me note that 19033 and 43175: 43175 is 2×19033 + 5109? Wait, 2×19033=38066, 43175-38066=5109. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps compute numerically.",
    "But this seems tedious. Alternatively, maybe notice that each term alternates between below and above 0.5? Wait, x₁≈2.27, x₂≈0.57 (above 0.5), x₃≈0.44 (below 0.5), x₄≈0.5696 (above 0.5), x₅≈0.44, etc. So oscillating around 0.5, converging towards it? Maybe. If it converges to 0.5, then perhaps after many iterations, it gets very close. But 2025 is a very large number, so maybe it's approaching 1/2. But even if it converges, we need the exact value, not an approximation. So convergence isn't helpful here unless we can find a closed-form expression.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this recursion can be transformed into a linear recurrence or something else. Let's see:\n\nGiven x_{k+1} = (x_k + 1/x_k -1)/3.\n\nMultiply both sides by 3x_k:\n\n3x_k x_{k+1} = x_k² +1 -x_k.\n\nRearranged:\n\nx_k² -3x_k x_{k+1} -x_k +1=0.",
    "This is a quadratic in x_k, but not sure if helpful. Alternatively, perhaps consider defining a new variable. Let me think.",
    "Alternatively, let's consider defining y_k = x_k - 1/2. Since the fixed point is 1/2, maybe shifting the sequence by 1/2 could linearize the recurrence. Let's try:\n\nLet y_k = x_k - 1/2. Then x_k = y_k + 1/2. Substitute into the recursion:\n\nx_{k+1} = (x_k + 1/x_k -1)/3 = ( (y_k + 1/2) + 1/(y_k + 1/2) -1 ) /3.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(y_k +1/2 -1) + 1/(y_k +1/2) = (y_k -1/2) + 1/(y_k +1/2).\n\nSo x_{k+1} = [ (y_k -1/2) + 1/(y_k +1/2) ] /3.\n\nNot sure if helpful. Maybe expand 1/(y_k +1/2) as a series if y_k is small (if converging to 1/2, then y_k would be approaching 0). But since we need exact values, series expansion isn't helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider reciprocal again. Let’s define z_k = 1/(x_k - 1/2). Then x_k = 1/z_k +1/2. Substitute into recursion:\n\nx_{k+1} = (x_k +1/x_k -1)/3.\n\nPlugging in x_k =1/z_k +1/2:\n\nx_{k+1} = [ (1/z_k +1/2) + 1/(1/z_k +1/2) -1 ] /3.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: 1/z_k +1/2.\n\nSecond term: 1/(1/z_k +1/2) = 1/( (1 + z_k/2)/z_k ) = z_k / (1 + z_k/2) = 2z_k/(2 + z_k).\n\nThird term: -1.\n\nSo altogether:\n\n[ (1/z_k +1/2) + 2z_k/(2 + z_k) -1 ] /3.\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n1/z_k +1/2 -1 + 2z_k/(2 + z_k) = (1/z_k -1/2) + 2z_k/(2 + z_k).\n\nNot sure if helpful. This seems complicated.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps look for a substitution that can turn this into a linear fractional transformation or something that can be iterated. Alternatively, maybe consider continued fractions? Not sure.",
    "Alternatively, maybe notice that the recursion resembles a Newton-Raphson iteration for finding roots, but not exactly. Or perhaps relate to some trigonometric identity? Not sure.",
    "Alternatively, compute more terms to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nWait, let's compute x₂ = 157/275 ≈0.5709, x₃=19033/43175≈0.4408, x₄ would be (x₃ +1/x₃ -1)/3.

Then x₅=(0.5696 +1/0.5696 -1)/3≈(0.5696 +1.756 -1)/3≈(1.3256)/3≈0.4419. Then x₆≈(0.4419 +2.263 -1)/3≈(1.7049)/3≈0.5683. Then x₇≈(0.5683 +1.759 -1)/3≈(1.3273)/3≈0.4424. Then x₈≈0.568, x₉≈0.4425... So it's oscillating around 0.5, converging slowly? Each term alternates between ~0.44 and ~0.57, getting closer each time. So perhaps the even terms approach 0.5 from above, odd terms approach 0.5 from below? But with such a slow convergence, after 2025 terms, would it be indistinguishable from 0.5? But the problem states that x_{2025} is a rational number, so it must be an exact fraction. Therefore, there must be some periodicity or exact formula.",

    "Alternatively, since the problem asks for x_{2025}, which is a very large index, perhaps the sequence approaches a limit cycle or becomes periodic modulo some number. But given that each term is a reduced fraction, this seems unlikely unless the sequence actually becomes periodic after some terms.",
    "Wait, let's check if the sequence of y's becomes periodic.

    "Alternatively, perhaps after several iterations, the fractions repeat? But given the denominators are growing each time, this seems unlikely.",
    "Alternatively, maybe there's a telescoping product when writing the recursion in terms of continued fractions or some other transformation. Alternatively, perhaps consider that each term x_{k+1} is related to x_k through the given recursion, and after a certain number of steps, the transformation repeats modulo something.",
    "Alternatively, notice that the recursion is similar to a continued fraction expansion. Let me think.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps consider that the mapping x_{k+1} = (x_k +1/x_k -1)/3 can be represented as a Möbius transformation or some composition of functions.

    "Alternatively, consider the substitution t_k =x_k +1/x_k, which is y_k. But we already tried that.",
    "Alternatively, think of this recursion as similar to the arithmetic-harmonic mean iteration, but modified. The standard AHM iteration is a_{k+1}=(a_k +b_k)/2, b_{k+1}=2/(1/a_k +1/b_k). But not the same.",
    "Alternatively, notice that each term x_{k+1} is the average of x_k, 1/x_k, and -1, scaled by 1/3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider writing the recursion as:\n\nx_{k+1} -1/2 = (x_k +1/x_k -1)/3 -1/2.\n\nLet’s compute:\n\n(x_k +1/x_k -1)/3 -1/2 = (x_k +1/x_k -1 -3/2)/3 = (x_k +1/x_k -5/2)/3.\n\nSo x_{k+1} -1/2 = (x_k +1/x_k -5/2)/3.\n\nNot sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that if x_{k} is close to 1/2, then expanding around 1/2. Let’s set x_k =1/2 +ε_k, where ε_k is small. Then:\n\nx_{k+1}= (1/2 +ε_k +1/(1/2 +ε_k) -1)/3.\n\nCompute 1/(1/2 +ε_k)=2/(1 +2ε_k)≈2(1 -2ε_k +4ε_k² -...).\n\nSo approximately:\n\nx_{k+1}≈ [1/2 +ε_k +2(1 -2ε_k) -1]/3 = [1/2 +ε_k +2 -4ε_k -1]/3 = [ (1/2 +2 -1) + (ε_k -4ε_k) ] /3 = [3/2 -3ε_k]/3 = 1/2 -ε_k.\n\nSo x_{k+1} -1/2 ≈ -ε_k = -(x_k -1/2). Therefore, if x_k is near 1/2, the error term ε alternates sign and decreases in magnitude each step? But this is only valid for small ε, and since the sequence alternates around 1/2 with decreasing error, this suggests convergence to 1/2. However, this is an approximation and doesn't help us find the exact fraction after 2025 steps.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is periodic modulo some number, allowing us to compute x_{2025} modulo something. But since we need the exact numerator and denominator, this approach might not work unless the period is very small.",
    "Alternatively, notice that the recursion can be written as x_{k+1} = (x_k +1/x_k -1)/3. Let's consider multiplying numerator and denominator by x_k:\n\nx_{k+1} = (x_k² +1 -x_k)/(3x_k).\n\nThis resembles a formula where each term is defined based on the previous term's numerator and denominator. Let's denote x_k =a_k/b_k, where a_k and b_k are coprime positive integers. Then:\n\nx_{k+1} = ( (a_k/b_k)^2 +1 -a_k/b_k ) / (3a_k/b_k )\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by b_k²:\n\nx_{k+1} = (a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k ) / (3a_k b_k )\n\nSo x_{k+1} = (a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k ) / (3a_k b_k )\n\nTherefore, if x_k =a_k/b_k, then x_{k+1}= (a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k )/(3a_k b_k ). So we can represent x_{k+1} as a fraction where numerator is a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k and denominator is 3a_k b_k. Therefore, recursively, we can define:\n\na_{k+1} = a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k\n\nb_{k+1} =3a_k b_k\n\nWith a₁=25, b₁=11.\n\nTherefore, the sequence x_k =a_k /b_k, where a_k and b_k are defined by:\n\na_{k+1}=a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k\n\nb_{k+1}=3a_k b_k\n\nStarting with a₁=25, b₁=11.\n\nTherefore, perhaps we can compute a_k and b_k modulo 1000 to find m +n mod1000. However, since m and n are coprime, we need to compute a_{2025} and b_{2025}, reduce them to lowest terms, then sum m +n mod1000.\n\nBut computing a_{2025} and b_{2025} directly is impossible due to their size. However, perhaps we can find a pattern in a_k and b_k modulo 1000 or some other modulus.\n\nBut first, let's check if a_k and b_k are always coprime. Suppose that a_k and b_k are coprime. Then:\n\na_{k+1}=a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k\n\nb_{k+1}=3a_k b_k\n\nWe need to check if a_{k+1} and b_{k+1} are coprime.\n\nSuppose p is a prime dividing both a_{k+1} and b_{k+1}. Then p divides b_{k+1}=3a_k b_k. So p divides 3, a_k, or b_k. Also, p divides a_{k+1}=a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k.\n\nIf p divides a_k: Then since p divides a_{k+1}=a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k, and p divides a_k, then p divides b_k². But since a_k and b_k are coprime, p cannot divide b_k, contradiction. Similarly, if p divides b_k, then p divides a_k², again contradicting coprimality. Therefore, p must divide 3. So the only possible common divisor is 3.\n\nTherefore, gcd(a_{k+1},b_{k+1}) is either 1 or 3.\n\nCheck if 3 divides a_{k+1}:\n\nIf 3 divides a_{k+1}=a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k.\n\nIf a_k and b_k are not divisible by 3, then compute a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k mod3.\n\nLet’s suppose a_k ≡1 mod3, b_k≡1 mod3:\n\na_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k ≡1 +1 -1×1=1 mod3. Not divisible by3.\n\nSimilarly, a_k≡1, b_k≡2:\n\n1 +4 -2=3≡0 mod3.\n\nSimilarly, a_k≡2, b_k≡1:\n\n4 +1 -2=3≡0 mod3.\n\na_k≡2, b_k≡2:\n\n4 +4 -4=4≡1 mod3.\n\nTherefore, if a_k and b_k are not divisible by3, then a_{k+1}≡0 mod3 iff a_k and b_k are congruent to1 and2 or 2 and1 modulo3.\n\nBut starting with a₁=25≡1 mod3, b₁=11≡2 mod3. So a₁≡1, b₁≡2 mod3. Then a_{2}=a₁² +b₁² -a₁b₁=25² +11² -25×11=625 +121 -275=625+121=746-275=471. 471≡0 mod3. Indeed,471=3×157. So a₂=471, b₂=3×25×11=825.\n\ngcd(a₂,b₂)=gcd(471,825). As computed earlier, GCD is 3. So here, gcd(a₂,b₂)=3. Therefore, x₂=471/825=157/275 after dividing numerator and denominator by3.\n\nTherefore, the fractions x_k can be simplified by dividing by gcd(a_k,b_k), which is either1 or3. So when computing m/n as reduced fraction, m=a_k /gcd(a_k,b_k), n=b_k /gcd(a_k,b_k).\n\nTherefore, m +n= (a_k +b_k)/gcd(a_k,b_k). So to compute m +n mod1000, we need to compute (a_k +b_k)/gcd(a_k,b_k) mod1000.\n\nBut since gcd(a_k,b_k) is either1 or3, depending on whether a_k and b_k are congruent modulo3.\n\nBut tracking whether gcd(a_k,b_k) is1 or3 requires knowing whether a_k and b_k are divisible by3. However, perhaps we can find a pattern modulo some number where the sequence repeats.",
    "Alternatively, notice that the recursion for a_{k+1} and b_{k+1} can be considered modulo 1000. However, since each term depends on the previous terms squared and products, the numbers can get large quickly, but if we compute modulo 1000, we can keep track of a_k mod1000 and b_k mod1000, but we need to handle divisions by gcd(a_k,b_k), which complicates things.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps notice that after some steps, the sequence a_k and b_k modulo some number becomes periodic. Since we need the result modulo1000, perhaps compute the sequence modulo 1000, but taking into account the division by gcd(a_k,b_k).\n\nBut this seems complicated.

    "First, compute the offset from k=3:2025 -3=2022.\n\nThen compute2022 mod6. 2022 ÷6=337×6=2022, remainder0. Therefore,2022 mod6=0. Therefore, k=2025 corresponds to position0 in the cycle, which is208.\n\nTherefore, the answer is208.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{208}\n"
