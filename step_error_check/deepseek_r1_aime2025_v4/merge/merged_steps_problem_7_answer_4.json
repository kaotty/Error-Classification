      "content": "First, let's understand the setup. We have twelve letters from A to L. These are grouped into six pairs randomly. Then, within each pair, the letters are arranged in alphabetical order. So, for example, if a pair is (G, D), it becomes DG. Then, all six pairs are listed alphabetically. So the example given is AB, CJ, DG, EK, FL, HI. The last word in this list is HI. Wait, but in the example, HI is the last word. But we need the probability that the last word contains G. So in this example, the last word is HI, which doesn't contain G, so this case wouldn't count. \n\nSo the problem is asking: when you pair all twelve letters, arrange each pair alphabetically, then sort the six pairs alphabetically into a list, what's the probability that the last pair in this sorted list includes the letter G.\n\nAlright, so first, let's think about how the pairing works. Each letter is paired with another, no repeats. The total number of ways to pair twelve letters is (12 - 1)!! = 11!! = 11 × 9 × 7 × 5 × 3 × 1 = 10395. That's the total number of possible pairings. Each pairing is equally likely.\n\nNow, when we arrange each pair in alphabetical order, each pair becomes a two-letter word where the first letter is earlier in the alphabet. Then, these six words are sorted alphabetically. The last word in this sorted list is the one that comes last alphabetically. So, we need to find the probability that G is in this last word.\n\nTo approach this, maybe we can think about the position of G in the original pairing. Since the words are sorted alphabetically, the last word is the one with the highest starting letter. So, the last word starts with the highest possible starting letter among all six pairs. For example, if there's a pair starting with L, that's automatically the last word. If not, then the pair starting with K, etc.",

Since pairs are ordered alphabetically, if G is paired with a letter that comes after it, the pair will be G followed by that letter. If paired with a letter before it, the pair will be that letter followed by G.\n\nSo, for example, if G is paired with H, the pair is GH. If paired with F, it's FG. So, GH would come after FG in the sorted list.\n\nTherefore, the position of the pair containing G in the sorted list depends on the first letter of the pair. If G is paired with a higher letter, say H, I, J, K, L, then the pair starts with G, so its first letter is G. If paired with A-F, then the pair starts with the other letter, so the first letter is A-F. Therefore, the pair containing G could start with letters A-F or G.\n\nSo, for the pair containing G to be the last word, the starting letter of that pair must be the highest among all starting letters of the six pairs. So, if G is paired with a higher letter (H-L), then the starting letter is G. Otherwise, if paired with a lower letter (A-F), the starting letter is that lower letter.\n\nTherefore, the pair containing G will be the last word if and only if the starting letter of that pair is higher than the starting letters of all other pairs.\n\nWait, but if G is paired with a higher letter, say H, then the starting letter is G. So, unless there's another pair starting with H, I, J, K, or L, then G would not be the highest.

Therefore, if the highest starting letter among all pairs is, say, K, then the pair starting with K is the last word.

Therefore, the starting letter of the pair containing G is either G or some letter from A-F. Therefore, the highest starting letter among all pairs could be higher than G (H-L) or equal to G or lower.\n\nTherefore, the pair containing G will be the last word only if the highest starting letter among all pairs is G. Because if there's any pair starting with H, I, J, K, or L, then that pair will be the last word, and G's pair will not be the last. If the highest starting letter is G, then the pair starting with G (i.e., G paired with someone) will be the last word. If G is paired with a lower letter, then the starting letter is that lower letter, so unless all other pairs start with letters lower than that, which would require that lower letter to be higher than all others, which is impossible because G is higher.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nSuppose G is paired with H. Then the pair is GH. The starting letter is G. If there are no pairs starting with H, I, J, K, or L, then GH would be the last word. But if there is a pair starting with H, I, etc., then that pair would come after GH.\n\nAlternatively, if G is paired with F. Then the pair is FG. The starting letter is F. If there are pairs starting with G, H, I, J, K, or L, then FG would not be the last word. If all other pairs start with letters before F, which is impossible because we have letters A-F (excluding F if G is paired with F), but there are letters higher than F like G, H, etc. So, actually, if G is paired with a lower letter (A-F), then the pair starts with that lower letter. But since G is already paired with that lower letter, G is not in any other pair, so the remaining letters (A-F excluding the one paired with G) and H-L must form pairs. Therefore, unless all remaining pairs start with letters lower than F, which can't happen because H-L are still there. Therefore, if G is paired with a lower letter, the starting letter of that pair is lower than G, so there must be pairs starting with higher letters (H-L), so the pair containing G cannot be the last word. Therefore, the only way for the pair containing G to be the last word is if G is paired with a higher letter (H-L), and there are no pairs starting with letters higher than G. Because if G is paired with H, then the starting letter is G, but if someone else pairs H with another letter, say H paired with I, then HI would start with H, which is higher than G, making HI the last word. Therefore, for the pair containing G to be the last word, G must be paired with a letter higher than G (H-L), and all other pairs must start with letters less than or equal to G. But since H-L are letters higher than G, unless they are all paired with each other in such a way that their pairs start with letters higher than G. Wait, this is getting tangled.",

But since we have letters H-L (6 letters) remaining after pairing G with someone. Wait, let's think again.\n\nTotal letters: A-L (12 letters). If we pair G with a higher letter (H-L), then G is in a pair starting with G. The remaining letters are A-F and H-L (excluding G and its pair). Wait, no. If G is paired with H, then we've used G and H. The remaining letters are A-F, I, J, K, L (10 letters). These need to be paired into five pairs. Each of these pairs, when ordered, will start with their first letter. For the highest starting letter among all pairs to be G, none of these remaining pairs can start with H, I, J, K, or L. But the remaining letters include I, J, K, L. So unless those letters are paired with higher letters, but since they are the highest remaining letters, they can't be paired with higher letters. Wait, if we have letters I, J, K, L left, they need to be paired among themselves or with lower letters. If they are paired with lower letters (A-F), then the pair will start with the lower letter. For example, pairing I with A gives AI, starting with A. Pairing I with J gives IJ, starting with I. So, if any of the remaining letters H-L (but H was already paired with G in this case) are paired with each other, their pairs will start with H, I, J, K, or L. Therefore, unless all of the remaining letters H-L are paired with lower letters (A-F), the highest starting letter would be among H-L.\n\nBut wait, if G is paired with H, then remaining letters are A-F, I, J, K, L. If we pair I, J, K, L with A-F, then their pairs will start with A-F. If we pair them among themselves, their pairs start with I, J, K, L. Therefore, the highest starting letter among the remaining pairs is either among I-L if they are paired together, or among A-F if they are paired with lower letters.\n\nTherefore, for the highest starting letter overall to be G (from the pair GH), all remaining pairs must start with letters less than G (i.e., A-F). Therefore, we need to pair the remaining letters I, J, K, L (since H is already paired with G) with A-F such that each pair is a lower letter with a higher letter, thus starting with the lower letter. However, there are four letters I, J, K, L and six letters A-F. Wait, no: if G is paired with H, then remaining letters are A-F (6 letters) and I, J, K, L (4 letters). So total of 10 letters. These need to be paired into five pairs. To ensure that none of these pairs start with I, J, K, or L, we need each of I, J, K, L to be paired with a letter from A-F. Since there are four letters (I-L) and six letters (A-F), we can pair each of I-L with one of A-F, leaving two letters from A-F to be paired together. However, pairing two letters from A-F would result in a pair starting with A-F, which is okay since they are less than G. So in this scenario, the highest starting letter among the remaining pairs would be F (if the two leftover A-F letters are paired as, say, E and F, making EF starting with E). Wait, actually, the highest starting letter among the remaining pairs would be the highest starting letter among the pairs formed by A-F and I-L. If I-L are each paired with A-F, then each such pair starts with A-F. The leftover two letters from A-F would form a pair starting with the lower of the two. So the highest starting letter in the remaining pairs would be F if one of the leftover letters is F. But even if not, the highest starting letter would be whatever the highest starting letter is among those pairs. However, since all pairs involving I-L start with A-F, and any leftover A-F pairs also start with A-F, the highest starting letter among the remaining pairs is at most F. Therefore, the overall highest starting letter is G (from the pair GH), so GH would be the last word.",

Wait, when pairing distinct items, it's equivalent to a bijection. So if we have 4 higher letters and 4 A-F letters selected from 6, the number of ways is C(6,4) * 4! (choose 4 A-F letters, then assign each higher letter to a distinct A-F letter). Then, the remaining 2 A-F letters are paired together in 1 way (since pairs are unordered). However, pairing the remaining 2 A-F letters: since pairing is unordered, the number of ways is 1 (since there's only one pair possible). But wait, actually, when pairing the remaining letters, after pairing the 4 higher letters with 4 A-F letters, you have 2 A-F letters left. These can be paired in (2 - 1)!! = 1 way. So yes, 1 way.\n\nTherefore, for each choice of pairing G with a higher letter, the number of favorable pairings is C(6,4) * 4! * 1.

The number of ways to do this is C(6,4) * 4! because:\n\n- C(6,4): choose 4 A-F letters out of 6.\n\n- Then, assign each of the 4 higher letters to one of these 4 A-F letters, which is 4! permutations.\n\nBut since pairings are unordered, does this matter? Hmm, actually, when forming the pairs, the order between the pairs doesn't matter, but each pair is ordered alphabetically. Wait, but in this case, we're counting the number of pairings where higher letters are paired with specific A-F letters. Since the pairings are unordered collections of pairs, the number of ways to pair 4 higher letters with 4 A-F letters is C(6,4) multiplied by the number of matchings between the 4 higher letters and 4 A-F letters. The number of matchings is 4! (since it's a bijection). Therefore, yes, C(6,4) * 4!.\n\nThen, the remaining 2 A-F letters are paired together, which can be done in 1 way.\n\nTherefore, total number of favorable pairings is 5 * [C(6,4) * 4!].\n\nBut wait, let's compute this:\n\nC(6,4) = 15.\n\n4! = 24.\n\nSo 15 * 24 = 360.\n\nThen, multiplied by 5 (choices for pairing G with a higher letter): 360 * 5 = 1800.\n\nBut wait, total number of pairings is 11!! = 10395.\n\nSo the probability would be 1800 / 10395.\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 15: 1800 ÷ 15 = 120; 10395 ÷ 15 = 693.\n\nSo 120 / 693.

Wait, this contradicts. If all pairs start with letters ≤ G, then letters H-L must be paired with letters A-G such that in each pair, the lower letter is ≤ G. Therefore, letters H-L must be paired with letters A-G, so each pair will start with A-G. Therefore, the number of pairings where all pairs start with letters ≤ G is equal to the number of ways to pair H-L with A-G, and pair the remaining A-G letters among themselves.\n\nWait, letters A-G: 7 letters. H-L: 5 letters. So pairing each of H-L with A-G, using 5 letters from A-G, leaving 2 letters from A-G. Then pair those 2 letters together. So the number of such pairings is C(7,5) * 5! * (1) * (pair the remaining 2 A-G letters). Wait, C(7,5) is choosing 5 letters from A-G to pair with H-L. Then, assigning each H-L to one of these 5 letters: 5! ways. Then, the remaining 2 A-G letters are paired together: 1 way. Then, the rest of the letters (the other A-G letters not used in pairing with H-L) are already paired? Wait, no. Wait, total letters are 12. If we pair H-L (5 letters) with 5 letters from A-G, and pair the remaining 2 A-G letters together, that accounts for 5 + 5 + 2 = 12 letters. Wait, H-L (5) + paired A-G (5) + remaining A-G (2) = 12. So yes. Then, the total pairings where all pairs start with letters ≤ G is C(7,5) * 5! * 1. Then, the total number of such pairings is C(7,5) * 5! = 21 * 120 = 2520.\n\nBut the total number of pairings is 11!! = 10395. Therefore, the probability that all pairs start with letters ≤ G is 2520 / 10395 = 504 / 2079 = 168 / 693 = 56 / 231 = 8 / 33 ≈ 0.2424. But this is the probability that the highest starting letter is ≤ G. However, we need the probability that the highest starting letter is exactly G. So, subtract the probability that the highest starting letter is ≤ F.\n\nSimilarly, the probability that the highest starting letter is ≤ F is calculated by pairing G-L (6 letters) with A-F (6 letters). So pairing each of G-L with A-F, which requires pairing 6 letters (G-L) with 6 letters (A-F). The number of such pairings is C(6,6) * 6! = 1 * 720 = 720. Then, pair the remaining A-F letters (0) since all are used. So total pairings: 720. Therefore, probability is 720 / 10395 = 144 / 2079 = 48 / 693 = 16 / 231 ≈ 0.06926.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the highest starting letter is exactly G is the probability that all pairs start with ≤ G minus the probability that all pairs start with ≤ F. So 2520 / 10395 - 720 / 10395 = (2520 - 720) / 10395 = 1800 / 10395 = same as before, 40 / 231. Therefore, confirms the previous result.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 40/231, so m + n = 40 + 231 = 271.",

Since G is paired with one higher letter, the remaining higher letters (H-L excluding G's pair) must be paired with letters ≤ G. So, letters H-L are 5 letters. Pairing G with one of them leaves 4 higher letters. These 4 higher letters must be paired with letters ≤ G (A-G). But G is already paired with a higher letter, so G is available. Wait, no: if G is paired with, say, H, then G is used up, so remaining letters are A-F and I, J, K, L. Wait, letters ≤ G are A-F and G.

    "\n\nOkay, so I need to find the probability that when twelve letters (A to L) are randomly paired into six two-letter words, and those words are listed alphabetically, the last word contains the letter G. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.",
    "First, let's understand the setup. We have twelve letters from A to L. These are grouped into six pairs randomly. Then, within each pair, the letters are arranged in alphabetical order. So, for example, if a pair is (G, D), it becomes DG. Then, all six pairs are listed alphabetically. So the example given is AB, CJ, DG, EK, FL, HI. The last word in this list is HI. Wait, but in the example, HI is the last word. But we need the probability that the last word contains G. So in this example, the last word is HI, which doesn't contain G, so this case wouldn't count. \n\nSo the problem is asking: when you pair all twelve letters, arrange each pair alphabetically, then sort the six pairs alphabetically into a list, what's the probability that the last pair in this sorted list includes the letter G.\n\nAlright, so first, let's think about how the pairing works. Each letter is paired with another, no repeats. The total number of ways to pair twelve letters is (12 - 1)!! = 11!! = 11 × 9 × 7 × 5 × 3 × 1 = 10395. That's the total number of possible pairings. Each pairing is equally likely.\n\nNow, when we arrange each pair in alphabetical order, each pair becomes a two-letter word where the first letter is earlier in the alphabet. Then, these six words are sorted alphabetically. The last word in this sorted list is the one that comes last alphabetically. So, we need to find the probability that G is in this last word.\n\nTo approach this, maybe we can think about the position of G in the original pairing. Since the words are sorted alphabetically, the last word is the one with the highest starting letter. So, the last word starts with the highest possible starting letter among all six pairs. For example, if there's a pair starting with L, that's automatically the last word. If not, then the pair starting with K, etc.",
    "But G is somewhere in the middle. So, for G to be in the last word, G must be paired with a letter such that their pair is the highest in the sorted list. Alternatively, maybe G is paired with a letter that when ordered alphabetically, the pair becomes something that ends up being the last word.",
    "Wait, but G could be either the first or the second letter in its pair. Since pairs are ordered alphabetically, if G is paired with a letter that comes after it, the pair will be G followed by that letter. If paired with a letter before it, the pair will be that letter followed by G.\n\nSo, for example, if G is paired with H, the pair is GH. If paired with F, it's FG. So, GH would come after FG in the sorted list.\n\nTherefore, the position of the pair containing G in the sorted list depends on the first letter of the pair. If G is paired with a higher letter, say H, I, J, K, L, then the pair starts with G, so its first letter is G. If paired with A-F, then the pair starts with the other letter, so the first letter is A-F. Therefore, the pair containing G could start with letters A-F or G.\n\nSo, for the pair containing G to be the last word, the starting letter of that pair must be the highest among all starting letters of the six pairs. So, if G is paired with a higher letter (H-L), then the starting letter is G. Otherwise, if paired with a lower letter (A-F), the starting letter is that lower letter.\n\nTherefore, the pair containing G will be the last word if and only if the starting letter of that pair is higher than the starting letters of all other pairs.\n\nWait, but if G is paired with a higher letter, say H, then the starting letter is G. So, unless there's another pair starting with H, I, J, K, or L, then G would not be the highest. So, actually, for the pair containing G to be the last word, the starting letter of that pair must be the highest possible. So, if G is paired with H, then the starting letter is G. But if another pair starts with H, I, J, K, or L, then that pair would come after G's pair. Therefore, the pair containing G can only be the last word if G is paired with the highest available letter, and there are no pairs starting with higher letters.",
    "Alternatively, if G is paired with a lower letter (A-F), then the starting letter is that lower letter. But then, unless all other pairs start with letters lower than that, which would be impossible if G is paired with F, since there are letters higher than F. Wait, this seems complicated.",
    "Wait, perhaps another approach: Let's consider all possible pairings. For each pairing, after arranging each pair in alphabetical order and sorting all pairs alphabetically, the last pair is the one with the highest starting letter. So, the key is that the last pair is determined by the highest starting letter among all pairs. Therefore, if the highest starting letter among all pairs is, say, K, then the pair starting with K is the last word. If the highest starting letter is G, then the pair starting with G is the last word. So, the probability that G is in the last word is the probability that the highest starting letter among all pairs is either G or the starting letter of the pair containing G is the highest.",
    "Wait, but if G is paired with a higher letter (H-L), then the pair starts with G. If G is paired with a lower letter (A-F), then the pair starts with that lower letter. Therefore, the starting letter of the pair containing G is either G or some letter from A-F. Therefore, the highest starting letter among all pairs could be higher than G (H-L) or equal to G or lower.\n\nTherefore, the pair containing G will be the last word only if the highest starting letter among all pairs is G. Because if there's any pair starting with H, I, J, K, or L, then that pair will be the last word, and G's pair will not be the last. If the highest starting letter is G, then the pair starting with G (i.e., G paired with someone) will be the last word. If G is paired with a lower letter, then the starting letter is that lower letter, so unless all other pairs start with letters lower than that, which would require that lower letter to be higher than all others, which is impossible because G is higher.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nSuppose G is paired with H. Then the pair is GH. The starting letter is G. If there are no pairs starting with H, I, J, K, or L, then GH would be the last word. But if there is a pair starting with H, I, etc., then that pair would come after GH.\n\nAlternatively, if G is paired with F. Then the pair is FG. The starting letter is F. If there are pairs starting with G, H, I, J, K, or L, then FG would not be the last word. If all other pairs start with letters before F, which is impossible because we have letters A-F (excluding F if G is paired with F), but there are letters higher than F like G, H, etc. So, actually, if G is paired with a lower letter (A-F), then the pair starts with that lower letter. But since G is already paired with that lower letter, G is not in any other pair, so the remaining letters (A-F excluding the one paired with G) and H-L must form pairs. Therefore, unless all remaining pairs start with letters lower than F, which can't happen because H-L are still there. Therefore, if G is paired with a lower letter, the starting letter of that pair is lower than G, so there must be pairs starting with higher letters (H-L), so the pair containing G cannot be the last word. Therefore, the only way for the pair containing G to be the last word is if G is paired with a higher letter (H-L), and there are no pairs starting with letters higher than G. Because if G is paired with H, then the starting letter is G, but if someone else pairs H with another letter, say H paired with I, then HI would start with H, which is higher than G, making HI the last word. Therefore, for the pair containing G to be the last word, G must be paired with a letter higher than G (H-L), and all other pairs must start with letters less than or equal to G. But since H-L are letters higher than G, unless they are all paired with each other in such a way that their pairs start with letters higher than G. Wait, this is getting tangled.",
    "Alternative approach: Let's think of the highest starting letter among all pairs. The last word is determined by the highest starting letter. So, the highest starting letter could be any letter from A to L. The probability that the highest starting letter is G or higher. Wait, no. Wait, if the highest starting letter is H, then the last word starts with H, and G is not in that pair unless G is paired with H. Similarly, if the highest starting letter is G, then the last word is the pair starting with G, which contains G. So, the probability that the last word contains G is equal to the probability that the highest starting letter is G, and G is in that pair. Wait, but if the highest starting letter is G, then the pair starting with G must be G paired with some higher letter (since pairs are ordered alphabetically). So, if the highest starting letter is G, then G is paired with H, I, J, K, or L. But if G is paired with H, then H is in that pair, but H is not a starting letter because the pair is GH. Wait, no, starting letters are determined by the pair. So, if G is paired with H, the pair is GH, starting with G. If H is paired with someone else, say H paired with I, then HI starts with H. So, the highest starting letter would be H in that case, making HI the last word. Therefore, the highest starting letter is H if there's any pair starting with H, I, J, K, or L.",
    "Therefore, for the highest starting letter to be G, there must be no pairs starting with H, I, J, K, or L. So all pairs must start with A-G. But since we have letters H-L (6 letters) remaining after pairing G with someone. Wait, let's think again.\n\nTotal letters: A-L (12 letters). If we pair G with a higher letter (H-L), then G is in a pair starting with G. The remaining letters are A-F and H-L (excluding G and its pair). Wait, no. If G is paired with H, then we've used G and H. The remaining letters are A-F, I, J, K, L (10 letters). These need to be paired into five pairs. Each of these pairs, when ordered, will start with their first letter. For the highest starting letter among all pairs to be G, none of these remaining pairs can start with H, I, J, K, or L. But the remaining letters include I, J, K, L. So unless those letters are paired with higher letters, but since they are the highest remaining letters, they can't be paired with higher letters. Wait, if we have letters I, J, K, L left, they need to be paired among themselves or with lower letters. If they are paired with lower letters (A-F), then the pair will start with the lower letter. For example, pairing I with A gives AI, starting with A. Pairing I with J gives IJ, starting with I. So, if any of the remaining letters H-L (but H was already paired with G in this case) are paired with each other, their pairs will start with H, I, J, K, or L. Therefore, unless all of the remaining letters H-L are paired with lower letters (A-F), the highest starting letter would be among H-L.\n\nBut wait, if G is paired with H, then remaining letters are A-F, I, J, K, L. If we pair I, J, K, L with A-F, then their pairs will start with A-F. If we pair them among themselves, their pairs start with I, J, K, L. Therefore, the highest starting letter among the remaining pairs is either among I-L if they are paired together, or among A-F if they are paired with lower letters.\n\nTherefore, for the highest starting letter overall to be G (from the pair GH), all remaining pairs must start with letters less than G (i.e., A-F). Therefore, we need to pair the remaining letters I, J, K, L (since H is already paired with G) with A-F such that each pair is a lower letter with a higher letter, thus starting with the lower letter. However, there are four letters I, J, K, L and six letters A-F. Wait, no: if G is paired with H, then remaining letters are A-F (6 letters) and I, J, K, L (4 letters). So total of 10 letters. These need to be paired into five pairs. To ensure that none of these pairs start with I, J, K, or L, we need each of I, J, K, L to be paired with a letter from A-F. Since there are four letters (I-L) and six letters (A-F), we can pair each of I-L with one of A-F, leaving two letters from A-F to be paired together. However, pairing two letters from A-F would result in a pair starting with A-F, which is okay since they are less than G. So in this scenario, the highest starting letter among the remaining pairs would be F (if the two leftover A-F letters are paired as, say, E and F, making EF starting with E). Wait, actually, the highest starting letter among the remaining pairs would be the highest starting letter among the pairs formed by A-F and I-L. If I-L are each paired with A-F, then each such pair starts with A-F. The leftover two letters from A-F would form a pair starting with the lower of the two. So the highest starting letter in the remaining pairs would be F if one of the leftover letters is F. But even if not, the highest starting letter would be whatever the highest starting letter is among those pairs. However, since all pairs involving I-L start with A-F, and any leftover A-F pairs also start with A-F, the highest starting letter among the remaining pairs is at most F. Therefore, the overall highest starting letter is G (from the pair GH), so GH would be the last word.",
    "Therefore, in this case, if G is paired with H, and the remaining I, J, K, L are each paired with A-F, with two A-F letters left to pair together, then the highest starting letter is G, so the last word is GH, containing G. Similarly, if G is paired with I, J, K, or L, the same logic applies: pair G with, say, I, then remaining letters H, J, K, L must be paired with A-F such that none of their pairs start with H, J, K, L. Wait, but H is still in the remaining letters if G is paired with I. Wait, no: if G is paired with I, then remaining letters are A-F, H, J, K, L. So H is still there. So H must also be paired with A-F to prevent a pair starting with H. Therefore, in general, if G is paired with any letter higher than G (H-L), then all remaining letters higher than G (H-L excluding the one paired with G) must be paired with letters lower than G (A-F) so that their pairs start with A-F. Then, any leftover A-F letters can be paired among themselves, starting with letters up to F.\n\nTherefore, the condition for the highest starting letter to be G is that G is paired with a higher letter (H-L), and all other higher letters (H-L excluding G's pair) are paired with lower letters (A-F). Then, the remaining A-F letters can be paired arbitrarily.",
    "Therefore, the number of favorable pairings is the number of ways to pair G with H, I, J, K, or L (5 choices), then pair the remaining 5 higher letters (since total higher letters are H-L, which is 6 letters, minus 1 paired with G, leaving 5) with A-F letters. However, there are 6 A-F letters, so pairing 5 higher letters with 5 of the A-F letters, leaving 1 A-F letter unpaired. Then, pair the remaining 1 A-F letter with someone else? Wait, no. Wait, total remaining letters after pairing G with, say, H: A-F (6 letters) and I, J, K, L (4 letters). Wait, no, if G is paired with H, remaining higher letters are I, J, K, L (4 letters), not 5. Wait, original higher letters are H, I, J, K, L (5 letters). Wait, wait, letters higher than G are H, I, J, K, L. That's 6 letters: H, I, J, K, L (wait, from A to L, G is the 7th letter). Wait, A is 1, B is 2, ..., G is 7, H is 8, I is 9, J is 10, K is 11, L is 12. So letters higher than G are H, I, J, K, L: 5 letters? Wait, no: H is 8, I is 9, J is 10, K is 11, L is 12. So letters higher than G (7) are H (8), I (9), J (10), K (11), L (12). That's 5 letters. Wait, but H is 8, so 12 - 7 = 5 letters higher than G. So letters higher than G: H, I, J, K, L (5 letters). Therefore, if G is paired with one of them, say H, then remaining higher letters are I, J, K, L (4 letters). These need to be paired with A-F letters (6 letters). So we need to pair each of these 4 higher letters with an A-F letter, leaving 6 - 4 = 2 A-F letters. Then, these 2 A-F letters are paired together. Similarly, if G is paired with I, remaining higher letters are H, J, K, L (4 letters), same thing.",
    "Wait, but H is part of the higher letters. If G is paired with H, remaining higher letters are I, J, K, L. If G is paired with I, remaining higher letters are H, J, K, L. So regardless of which higher letter G is paired with, there are 4 remaining higher letters. So we need to pair each of these 4 with A-F letters. There are 6 A-F letters, so we can choose 4 of them to pair with the 4 remaining higher letters, and then pair the remaining 2 A-F letters together.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable pairings is:\n\nNumber of choices for pairing G with a higher letter (5 choices: H, I, J, K, L).\n\nFor each such choice:\n\n- Pair the 4 remaining higher letters with 4 of the 6 A-F letters.\n\n- Then pair the remaining 2 A-F letters together.\n\nThe number of ways to pair the 4 higher letters with 4 A-F letters is C(6,4) * 4! (since we choose 4 A-F letters and then pair each higher letter with one of them). Wait, actually, pairing letters without order: if we have 4 higher letters and 6 A-F letters, the number of ways to pair the 4 higher letters with 4 A-F letters is C(6,4) * (4! / (2!^2))? Wait, no. Wait, when pairing distinct items, it's equivalent to a bijection. So if we have 4 higher letters and 4 A-F letters selected from 6, the number of ways is C(6,4) * 4! (choose 4 A-F letters, then assign each higher letter to a distinct A-F letter). Then, the remaining 2 A-F letters are paired together in 1 way (since pairs are unordered). However, pairing the remaining 2 A-F letters: since pairing is unordered, the number of ways is 1 (since there's only one pair possible). But wait, actually, when pairing the remaining letters, after pairing the 4 higher letters with 4 A-F letters, you have 2 A-F letters left. These can be paired in (2 - 1)!! = 1 way. So yes, 1 way.\n\nTherefore, for each choice of pairing G with a higher letter, the number of favorable pairings is C(6,4) * 4! * 1. Wait, but hold on: pairing the higher letters with A-F letters is equivalent to creating 4 pairs where each pair consists of a higher letter and an A-F letter. The number of ways to do this is C(6,4) * 4! because:\n\n- C(6,4): choose 4 A-F letters out of 6.\n\n- Then, assign each of the 4 higher letters to one of these 4 A-F letters, which is 4! permutations.\n\nBut since pairings are unordered, does this matter? Hmm, actually, when forming the pairs, the order between the pairs doesn't matter, but each pair is ordered alphabetically. Wait, but in this case, we're counting the number of pairings where higher letters are paired with specific A-F letters. Since the pairings are unordered collections of pairs, the number of ways to pair 4 higher letters with 4 A-F letters is C(6,4) multiplied by the number of matchings between the 4 higher letters and 4 A-F letters. The number of matchings is 4! (since it's a bijection). Therefore, yes, C(6,4) * 4!.\n\nThen, the remaining 2 A-F letters are paired together, which can be done in 1 way.\n\nTherefore, total number of favorable pairings is 5 * [C(6,4) * 4!].\n\nBut wait, let's compute this:\n\nC(6,4) = 15.\n\n4! = 24.\n\nSo 15 * 24 = 360.\n\nThen, multiplied by 5 (choices for pairing G with a higher letter): 360 * 5 = 1800.\n\nBut wait, total number of pairings is 11!! = 10395.\n\nSo the probability would be 1800 / 10395.\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 15: 1800 ÷ 15 = 120; 10395 ÷ 15 = 693.\n\nSo 120 / 693. Then divide numerator and denominator by 3: 120 ÷ 3 = 40; 693 ÷ 3 = 231.\n\nSo 40 / 231. Check if this reduces further. 40 and 231 share a GCD of 1 (since 231 ÷ 40 = 5.775, and 40 ÷ 11 = 3.636, GCD(40,231) = 1). Therefore, simplified fraction is 40/231. So m = 40, n = 231, m + n = 271.",
    "Wait, but hold on. Is this correct? Let me verify.\n\nWait, but when we pair G with a higher letter, say H, and then pair the remaining higher letters (I, J, K, L) with A-F letters, is that all? Wait, but if G is paired with H, then H is already used, so remaining higher letters are I, J, K, L (4 letters). Then, pairing them with A-F letters (6 letters). So selecting 4 A-F letters and pairing each higher letter with one. Then, remaining 2 A-F letters are paired together. So the total number of pairings in this case is C(6,4) * 4! * 1. Then multiplied by 5 (for each choice of pairing G with H, I, J, K, L). So total favorable pairings: 5 * C(6,4) * 4! = 5 * 15 * 24 = 5 * 360 = 1800. Total pairings: 11!! = 10395. So probability is 1800 / 10395 = 40 / 231 ≈ 0.173. Then m + n = 40 + 231 = 271.",
    "But wait, let's check another approach to confirm.",
    "Alternative approach: The probability that G is in the last pair is equal to the probability that G is paired with the \"maximum\" letter among all letters. Wait, but the last word is determined by the highest starting letter. So if the highest starting letter is G, then G is in the last word. If the highest starting letter is higher than G, then G is not in the last word. Therefore, the probability that G is in the last word is equal to the probability that the highest starting letter among all pairs is G.\n\nSo, compute the probability that all pairs start with letters ≤ G, and at least one pair starts with G.",
    "Total letters are A-L. If all pairs start with letters ≤ G, then all pairs must consist of letters A-G. But since we have letters H-L (5 letters) remaining, which are higher than G. Wait, this contradicts. If all pairs start with letters ≤ G, then letters H-L must be paired with letters A-G such that in each pair, the lower letter is ≤ G. Therefore, letters H-L must be paired with letters A-G, so each pair will start with A-G. Therefore, the number of pairings where all pairs start with letters ≤ G is equal to the number of ways to pair H-L with A-G, and pair the remaining A-G letters among themselves.\n\nWait, letters A-G: 7 letters. H-L: 5 letters. So pairing each of H-L with A-G, using 5 letters from A-G, leaving 2 letters from A-G. Then pair those 2 letters together. So the number of such pairings is C(7,5) * 5! * (1) * (pair the remaining 2 A-G letters). Wait, C(7,5) is choosing 5 letters from A-G to pair with H-L. Then, assigning each H-L to one of these 5 letters: 5! ways. Then, the remaining 2 A-G letters are paired together: 1 way. Then, the rest of the letters (the other A-G letters not used in pairing with H-L) are already paired? Wait, no. Wait, total letters are 12. If we pair H-L (5 letters) with 5 letters from A-G, and pair the remaining 2 A-G letters together, that accounts for 5 + 5 + 2 = 12 letters. Wait, H-L (5) + paired A-G (5) + remaining A-G (2) = 12. So yes. Then, the total pairings where all pairs start with letters ≤ G is C(7,5) * 5! * 1. Then, the total number of such pairings is C(7,5) * 5! = 21 * 120 = 2520.\n\nBut the total number of pairings is 11!! = 10395. Therefore, the probability that all pairs start with letters ≤ G is 2520 / 10395 = 504 / 2079 = 168 / 693 = 56 / 231 = 8 / 33 ≈ 0.2424. But this is the probability that the highest starting letter is ≤ G. However, we need the probability that the highest starting letter is exactly G. So, subtract the probability that the highest starting letter is ≤ F.\n\nSimilarly, the probability that the highest starting letter is ≤ F is calculated by pairing G-L (6 letters) with A-F (6 letters). So pairing each of G-L with A-F, which requires pairing 6 letters (G-L) with 6 letters (A-F). The number of such pairings is C(6,6) * 6! = 1 * 720 = 720. Then, pair the remaining A-F letters (0) since all are used. So total pairings: 720. Therefore, probability is 720 / 10395 = 144 / 2079 = 48 / 693 = 16 / 231 ≈ 0.06926.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the highest starting letter is exactly G is the probability that all pairs start with ≤ G minus the probability that all pairs start with ≤ F. So 2520 / 10395 - 720 / 10395 = (2520 - 720) / 10395 = 1800 / 10395 = same as before, 40 / 231. Therefore, confirms the previous result.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 40/231, so m + n = 40 + 231 = 271.",
    "But wait, let me check once more. When we compute the probability that the highest starting letter is exactly G, it's equal to the number of pairings where all pairs start with ≤ G and at least one pair starts with G, minus those where all pairs start with ≤ F. So yes, the calculation holds.\n\nAlternatively, another way: For the highest starting letter to be G, G must be paired with a higher letter (H-L), and all other higher letters (H-L) must be paired with letters ≤ G. Since G is paired with one higher letter, the remaining higher letters (H-L excluding G's pair) must be paired with letters ≤ G. So, letters H-L are 5 letters. Pairing G with one of them leaves 4 higher letters. These 4 higher letters must be paired with letters ≤ G (A-G). But G is already paired with a higher letter, so G is available. Wait, no: if G is paired with, say, H, then G is used up, so remaining letters are A-F and I, J, K, L. Wait, letters ≤ G are A-F and G. But G is already paired with H, so remaining letters ≤ G are A-F. Therefore, the remaining higher letters (I, J, K, L) must be paired with A-F. So yes, same as before. Therefore, the number of favorable pairings is 5 * C(6,4) * 4! = 5 * 15 * 24 = 1800, which matches the previous calculation.",
    "Therefore, the probability is 1800 / 10395 = 40 / 231, which simplifies to 40/231. Since 40 and 231 share no common factors (231 ÷ 7 = 33, 40 ÷ 7 ≈ 5.71), GCD(40,231) is 1. Wait, 231 factors: 3 × 7 × 11. 40 factors: 2^3 × 5. No common factors. Therefore, 40/231 is reduced, so m + n = 40 + 231 = 271.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 271.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{271}\n"
