Wait, but AF is a median? Since F is the midpoint of AB, AF connects A to F, which is the midpoint of AB, so yes, AF is a median.\n\nBut the circumcircle of DEF intersects these medians BD, AE, AF at points G, H, J. So DEF's circumcircle intersects BD at D (since D is a midpoint of BC and DEF is the medial triangle, D is a vertex of DEF, so D is on the circumcircle). Similarly, E and F are on the circumcircle.

Wait, DEF has sides parallel to AB, BC, AC? Wait, DE is parallel to AB, EF is parallel to BC, FD is parallel to AC. Therefore, angles in DEF correspond to angles in ABC but maybe rotated or something. Wait, angle at D in DEF: since DE is parallel to AB and DF is parallel to AC, then angle at D is equal to angle BAC? Wait, because DE is parallel to AB and DF is parallel to AC, so the angle between DE and DF at D would be the same as the angle between AB and AC at A, which is angle BAC = 84 degrees. Similarly, angle at E would be equal to angle ABC = 60 degrees, and angle at F would be equal to angle ACB = 36 degrees. Therefore, triangle DEF has angles 84°, 60°, 36°, same as ABC. Wait, but DEF is the medial triangle, so it's similar to ABC but scaled by 1/2. Wait, but angles remain the same. So DEF is similar to ABC with a ratio of 1:2. Therefore, angles in DEF are equal to angles in ABC, which are 84°, 60°, 36°. Therefore, the circumcircle of DEF has triangle DEF inscribed in it with those angles.\n\nBut wait, DEF is similar to ABC but scaled down. Therefore, the circumradius of DEF would be half the circumradius of ABC. But maybe we don't need the actual circumradius, but the arc measures. Since in the circumcircle of DEF, the arcs DE, HJ, FG correspond to certain central angles.\n\nWait, arc DE is the arc between D and E on the circumcircle of DEF. Since DEF is a triangle inscribed in its circumcircle, the arc DE would correspond to twice the angle at F in triangle DEF. Because in a circle, the central angle over an arc is twice the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc. So angle at F is 36°, so arc DE would be 72°. Similarly, arc EF would be 2* angle at D = 2*84°=168°, and arc FD would be 2* angle at E = 2*60°=120°. Wait, but DEF's angles are 84°, 60°, 36°, so arcs opposite those angles would be 2* those angles. Wait, no. Wait, in any triangle inscribed in a circle, the central angle over an arc is twice the opposite angle. Wait, if we have triangle DEF inscribed in a circle, then the arc DE is opposite angle F, so the central angle for arc DE is 2* angle F = 2*36°=72°, so arc DE is 72°. Similarly, arc EF would be 2* angle D = 2*84°=168°, and arc FD is 2* angle E = 2*60°=120°. Wait, but adding up 72+168+120=360°, which is correct. So arcs DE=72°, EF=168°, FD=120°. But in the problem, the points G, D, E, H, J, F divide the circle into six arcs. So the original arcs DE, EF, FD are each split into smaller arcs by points G, H, J.",

Assign coordinates to ABC, compute DEF, compute the circumcircle, find intersections G, H, J, then compute the arcs.\n\nLet me try coordinate geometry. Let's place triangle ABC in coordinate plane in a convenient way.\n\nLet me set vertex B at the origin (0,0). Let me let BC lie along the x-axis. Let me denote BC as side a, AC as side b, AB as side c. But maybe assigning coordinates based on angles.\n\nGiven angles at A, B, C: 84°, 60°, 36°. Let me denote vertex B at (0,0), vertex C at (c,0), vertex A somewhere in the plane. Then angle at B is 60°, angle at C is 36°, angle at A is 84°. Let's use the Law of Sines to find side lengths.\n\nLaw of Sines: In triangle ABC, a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C.\n\nWait, sides opposite angles: side a is BC, opposite angle A (84°); side b is AC, opposite angle B (60°); side c is AB, opposite angle C (36°).\n\nSo, a / sin 84° = b / sin 60° = c / sin 36°.\n\nLet me compute the ratios. Let me denote the circumradius of ABC as R. Then a = 2R sin A, etc. But maybe instead, assign a specific length for simplicity.\n\nLet me assume that the circumradius of ABC is 1 for simplicity. Then:\n\na = BC = 2R sin A = 2*1*sin 84° ≈ 2*0.9945 ≈ 1.989\n\nb = AC = 2R sin B = 2*1*sin 60° ≈ 2*(√3/2) ≈ 1.732\n\nc = AB = 2R sin C = 2*1*sin 36° ≈ 2*0.5878 ≈ 1.1756\n\nBut maybe instead of assuming R=1, let's assign BC to be of length 1. Then using Law of Sines:\n\na = BC = 1 = 2R sin 84° ⇒ R = 1 / (2 sin 84°)\n\nThen other sides:\n\nb = AC = 2R sin 60° = (1 / sin 84°) * sin 60° ≈ (1 / 0.9945) * 0.8660 ≈ 0.8707\n\nc = AB = 2R sin 36° = (1 / sin 84°) * sin 36° ≈ (1 / 0.9945) * 0.5878 ≈ 0.591\n\nBut maybe working with actual coordinates would be messy with these lengths. Alternatively, let's assign coordinates more cleverly.\n\nLet me place point B at (0,0), point C at (1,0). Then we need to find coordinates of point A such that angle at B is 60°, angle at C is 36°, and angle at A is 84°. Let's compute coordinates of A.\n\nUsing Law of Sines:\n\nBC / sin A = AB / sin C = AC / sin B\n\nGiven BC = 1, angle A = 84°, angle B = 60°, angle C = 36°.\n\nThus:\n\nAB = (BC * sin C) / sin A = (1 * sin 36°) / sin 84° ≈ (0.5878) / 0.9945 ≈ 0.591\n\nAC = (BC * sin B) / sin A = (1 * sin 60°) / sin 84° ≈ (0.8660) / 0.9945 ≈ 0.8707\n\nSo coordinates of A can be found using these distances. Let me compute coordinates.\n\nSince point B is at (0,0), point C is at (1,0). Let me place point A somewhere in the plane. Let me denote coordinates of A as (x,y). Then distance AB = sqrt(x² + y²) ≈ 0.591, distance AC = sqrt((x - 1)² + y²) ≈ 0.8707.\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\nx² + y² ≈ (0.591)² ≈ 0.349\n\n(x - 1)² + y² ≈ (0.8707)² ≈ 0.758\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n(x - 1)² + y² - x² - y² ≈ 0.758 - 0.349 ⇒ (x² - 2x + 1) - x² ≈ 0.409 ⇒ -2x + 1 ≈ 0.409 ⇒ -2x ≈ -0.591 ⇒ x ≈ 0.2955\n\nThen plugging back into x² + y² ≈ 0.349:\n\n(0.2955)^2 + y² ≈ 0.349 ⇒ 0.0873 + y² ≈ 0.349 ⇒ y² ≈ 0.2617 ⇒ y ≈ 0.5116\n\nSo coordinates of A are approximately (0.2955, 0.5116). Let me verify angles.\n\nUsing coordinates, angle at B (0,0) between BA and BC. Vector BA is (0.2955, 0.5116), vector BC is (1,0). The angle between BA and BC can be calculated using dot product:\n\ncos(theta) = (BA . BC) / (|BA| |BC|) = (0.2955 * 1 + 0.5116 * 0) / (0.591 * 1) ≈ 0.2955 / 0.591 ≈ 0.500 ⇒ theta ≈ 60°, which matches. Similarly, angle at C can be computed.\n\nVector CB is (-1,0), vector CA is (0.2955 - 1, 0.5116 - 0) = (-0.7045, 0.5116). The angle at C is between vectors CB and CA.\n\nDot product: (-1)(-0.7045) + 0*0.5116 = 0.7045. |CB| = 1, |CA| ≈ 0.8707.\n\ncos(theta) = 0.7045 / (1 * 0.8707) ≈ 0.7045 / 0.8707 ≈ 0.809, so theta ≈ 36°, which matches. Good.\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nB: (0,0)\n\nC: (1,0)\n\nA: approximately (0.2955, 0.5116)\n\nNow, midpoints D, E, F.\n\nD is midpoint of BC: ((0+1)/2, (0+0)/2) = (0.5, 0)\n\nE is midpoint of AC: ((0.2955 + 1)/2, (0.5116 + 0)/2) ≈ (0.64775, 0.2558)\n\nF is midpoint of AB: ((0 + 0.2955)/2, (0 + 0.5116)/2) ≈ (0.14775, 0.2558)\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nD: (0.5, 0)\n\nE: ≈ (0.64775, 0.2558)\n\nF: ≈ (0.14775, 0.2558)\n\nNow, DEF is the medial triangle with vertices at D, E, F.

Let's verify the distance to D, E, F.\n\nDistance to D(0.5,0):\n\nsqrt((0.5 -0.398)^2 + (0 -0.2296)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.0104 + 0.0527) ≈ sqrt(0.0631) ≈0.2512\n\nDistance to E(0.64775,0.2558):\n\nsqrt((0.64775 -0.398)^2 + (0.2558 -0.2296)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.0623 + 0.0007) ≈ sqrt(0.063) ≈0.251\n\nDistance to F(0.14775,0.2558):\n\nsqrt((0.14775 -0.398)^2 + (0.2558 -0.2296)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.0627 +0.0007) ≈ sqrt(0.0634)≈0.2518\n\nSo approximately equal radii (~0.251), which is consistent. So the circumradius is approximately 0.251 units in this coordinate system.\n\nNow, need to find points G, H, J where BD, AE, AF intersect the circumcircle of DEF again.\n\nFirst, BD is the median from B(0,0) to D(0.5,0). Wait, BD is the line from (0,0) to (0.5,0), which is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (0.5,0). But D is already on the circumcircle of DEF, so the other intersection point G is another point on BD and the circumcircle. But BD is the x-axis from (0,0) to (0.5,0). The circumcircle of DEF has center at approximately (0.398,0.2296) and radius ~0.251. So BD is the x-axis from (0,0) to (0.5,0). Let's parametrize BD: points on BD are (t,0) where t ranges from 0 to 0.5. We need to find another intersection point G of BD with the circumcircle, apart from D(0.5,0).\n\nSo substitute y=0 into the circumcircle equation. The circumcircle equation is (x -0.398)^2 + (y -0.2296)^2 ≈ (0.251)^2 ≈0.063.\n\nSetting y=0:\n\n(x -0.398)^2 + (0 -0.2296)^2 ≈0.063 ⇒ (x -0.398)^2 +0.0527 ≈0.063 ⇒ (x -0.398)^2 ≈0.0103 ⇒ x -0.398 ≈±0.1015 ⇒ x≈0.398±0.1015 ⇒ x≈0.4995 or x≈0.2965\n\nBut BD is from (0,0) to (0.5,0). So x ranges from 0 to 0.5. The solutions are x≈0.4995 (~0.5) and x≈0.2965. Since D is at (0.5,0), the other intersection point G is at approximately (0.2965,0).\n\nTherefore, G is at approximately (0.2965,0).\n\nSimilarly, find H on AE and J on AF.\n\nFirst, AE: median from A(0.2955,0.5116) to E(0.64775,0.2558). Let's parametrize AE.\n\nParametric equations: from A to E. Let parameter t go from 0 to 1.\n\nx(t) = 0.2955 + t*(0.64775 -0.2955) ≈0.2955 + t*0.35225\n\ny(t) =0.5116 + t*(0.2558 -0.5116) ≈0.5116 - t*0.2558\n\nWe need to find intersection H of AE with circumcircle of DEF, other than E.\n\nE is at t=1: (0.64775,0.2558). So H is another intersection point. Let's substitute x(t), y(t) into the circumcircle equation:\n\n(x -0.398)^2 + (y -0.2296)^2 ≈0.063\n\nSubstitute:\n\n(0.2955 +0.35225t -0.398)^2 + (0.5116 -0.2558t -0.2296)^2 ≈0.063\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-0.1025 +0.35225t)^2 + (0.282 -0.2558t)^2 ≈0.063\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (-0.1025 +0.35225t)^2 ≈ (0.35225t -0.1025)^2 ≈ (0.35225t)^2 -2*0.35225t*0.1025 +0.1025² ≈0.124t² -0.0723t +0.0105\n\nSecond term: (0.282 -0.2558t)^2 ≈ (-0.2558t +0.282)^2 ≈ (0.2558t)^2 -2*0.2558t*0.282 +0.282² ≈0.0654t² -0.1435t +0.0795\n\nSumming both terms:\n\n0.124t² -0.0723t +0.0105 +0.0654t² -0.1435t +0.0795 ≈ (0.124+0.0654)t² + (-0.0723 -0.1435)t + (0.0105 +0.0795) ≈0.1894t² -0.2158t +0.09\n\nSet equal to 0.063:\n\n0.1894t² -0.2158t +0.09 =0.063 ⇒0.1894t² -0.2158t +0.027=0\n\nSolve quadratic equation:\n\nt = [0.2158 ± sqrt(0.2158² -4*0.1894*0.027)] / (2*0.1894)\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n0.2158² ≈0.0466\n\n4*0.1894*0.027≈0.0204\n\nDiscriminant ≈0.0466 -0.0204≈0.0262\n\nsqrt(0.0262)≈0.1618\n\nThus,\n\nt≈[0.2158 ±0.1618]/0.3788\n\nFirst solution: (0.2158 +0.1618)/0.3788≈0.3776/0.3788≈0.996 ≈1.0\n\nSecond solution: (0.2158 -0.1618)/0.3788≈0.054/0.3788≈0.1426\n\nSo t≈1.0 corresponds to point E, so the other intersection H is at t≈0.1426.\n\nThus, coordinates of H:\n\nx≈0.2955 +0.35225*0.1426≈0.2955 +0.0502≈0.3457\n\ny≈0.5116 -0.2558*0.1426≈0.5116 -0.0365≈0.4751\n\nSo H is approximately (0.3457,0.4751)\n\nSimilarly, find J on AF. AF is the median from A(0.2955,0.5116) to F(0.14775,0.2558). Parametrize AF:\n\nx(t) =0.2955 + t*(0.14775 -0.2955)=0.2955 -0.14775t\n\ny(t)=0.5116 + t*(0.2558 -0.5116)=0.5116 -0.2558t\n\nFind intersection J with circumcircle of DEF other than F.\n\nF is at t=1: (0.14775,0.2558). So J is the other intersection point.\n\nSubstitute x(t), y(t) into circumcircle equation:\n\n(x -0.398)^2 + (y -0.2296)^2 ≈0.063\n\nSubstitute:\n\n(0.2955 -0.14775t -0.398)^2 + (0.5116 -0.2558t -0.2296)^2 ≈0.063\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-0.1025 -0.14775t)^2 + (0.282 -0.2558t)^2 ≈0.063\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (-0.1025 -0.14775t)^2 ≈ (0.14775t +0.1025)^2 ≈0.0218t² +0.0303t +0.0105\n\nSecond term: (0.282 -0.2558t)^2 ≈ same as before ≈0.0654t² -0.1435t +0.0795\n\nSumming:\n\n0.0218t² +0.0303t +0.0105 +0.0654t² -0.1435t +0.0795 ≈(0.0218+0.0654)t² + (0.0303 -0.1435)t + (0.0105 +0.0795)≈0.0872t² -0.1132t +0.09\n\nSet equal to 0.063:\n\n0.0872t² -0.1132t +0.09 =0.063 ⇒0.0872t² -0.1132t +0.027=0\n\nSolve quadratic:\n\nt = [0.1132 ± sqrt(0.1132² -4*0.0872*0.027)] / (2*0.0872)\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n0.1132²≈0.0128\n\n4*0.0872*0.027≈0.00942\n\nDiscriminant≈0.0128 -0.00942≈0.00338\n\nsqrt(0.00338)≈0.0581\n\nThus,\n\nt≈[0.1132 ±0.0581]/0.1744\n\nFirst solution: (0.1132 +0.0581)/0.1744≈0.1713/0.1744≈0.982≈1.0\n\nSecond solution: (0.1132 -0.0581)/0.1744≈0.0551/0.1744≈0.316\n\nSo t≈0.316 corresponds to point J.\n\nThus, coordinates of J:\n\nx≈0.2955 -0.14775*0.316≈0.2955 -0.0467≈0.2488\n\ny≈0.5116 -0.2558*0.316≈0.5116 -0.0809≈0.4307\n\nSo J is approximately (0.2488,0.4307)\n\nNow, we have coordinates of G(0.2965,0), H(0.3457,0.4751), J(0.2488,0.4307), along with D(0.5,0), E(0.64775,0.2558), F(0.14775,0.2558) on the circumcircle of DEF.\n\nNow, need to find the measures of arcs DE, HJ, FG.",

The power of point B with respect to the nine-point circle is equal to BG * BD = BH * BE = BJ * BF, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since DEF is the medial triangle, coordinates might be necessary, but my approximate calculation led to DE=72°, HJ≈24.5°, FG=72°, sum≈72 +49 +216=337°, but this seems messy. However, since DEF's angles are known, and arcs DE, EF, FD are 72°,168°,120°, but with points G,H,J inserted, dividing those arcs into smaller ones.\n\nWait, arc DE is72°, which is between D and E. Then arc EH is96°, HJ is24.5°, JF is47.5°, FG is72°, GD is48°, and so on. But perhaps there's a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, since G is on BD, which is a median, and DEF is the medial triangle, maybe BG is equal to GD? Wait, BD is a median of ABC, D is midpoint of BC. In DEF's circumcircle, D is a point on the circle. G is another intersection point. If BD is a median, and DEF is the medial triangle, then perhaps BG * GD = power of B with respect to the circle.\n\nPower of point B with respect to DEF's circumcircle: |BT|² - r², where BT is distance from B to center T.\n\nBut maybe compute it as BG * BD = power of B.\n\nGiven center at (0.398,0.2296), distance from B(0,0) to center:\n\nsqrt(0.398² +0.2296²)≈sqrt(0.1584 +0.0527)≈sqrt(0.2111)≈0.4595\n\nPower of B: (0.4595)² - (0.251)²≈0.211 -0.063≈0.148\n\nBut BG * BD = BG * 0.5 (since BD is length 0.5 in our coordinate system where BC=1). So BG *0.5≈0.148 ⇒ BG≈0.296. Which matches our coordinate calculation where G is at (0.2965,0), so BG≈0.2965, which is≈0.296. So this checks out.\n\nSimilarly, power of point A with respect to the circle: AH * AE = AJ * AF.\n\nBut this might not directly help with arc measures.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps noting that arcs FG and GD are related. In the coordinate calculation, FG was72°, but according to the problem statement, the arcs are DE, HJ, FG. Wait, DE is72°, HJ is24.5°, FG is72°, sum is72 +2*24.5 +3*72=72 +49 +216=337°, but this is likely incorrect due to coordinate approximation.",

    "\n\nOkay, so I need to solve this geometry problem involving triangle ABC with specific angles, midpoints, and intersections with the circumcircle of triangle DEF. The goal is to find the sum DE arc + 2*HJ arc + 3*FG arc, all measured in degrees. Let me try to break this down step by step.",
    "First, let me visualize triangle ABC. The angles are given: angle BAC is 84 degrees, angle ABC is 60 degrees, and angle ACB is 36 degrees. That adds up to 180, so that's good. Then, D, E, F are midpoints of sides BC, AC, AB respectively. So DEF is the medial triangle of ABC. The circumcircle of DEF is involved here. Then, this circumcircle intersects BD, AE, and AF at points G, H, J respectively. The points G, D, E, H, J, F divide the circumcircle into six minor arcs, and I need to compute the sum mentioned.",
    "First, maybe I should recall some properties about medial triangles. The medial triangle DEF connects the midpoints of the original triangle ABC. The circumcircle of DEF is called the nine-point circle of ABC, which also passes through the feet of the altitudes and the midpoints of the segments from each vertex to the orthocenter. But in this problem, maybe we don't need the nine-point circle properties directly. Instead, perhaps focusing on the medial triangle's circumcircle and the intersections with BD, AE, AF.",
    "Wait, BD is a median from B to AC? Wait, D is the midpoint of BC, so BD is a median? Wait, ABC has midpoints D, E, F. So BD would be a median from B to BC? Wait, no. Wait, BD connects vertex B to midpoint D of BC. So BD is a median. Similarly, AE connects A to midpoint E of AC, so AE is another median. AF connects A to midpoint F of AB, so AF is also a median. Wait, but AF is a median? Since F is the midpoint of AB, AF connects A to F, which is the midpoint of AB, so yes, AF is a median.\n\nBut the circumcircle of DEF intersects these medians BD, AE, AF at points G, H, J. So DEF's circumcircle intersects BD at D (since D is a midpoint of BC and DEF is the medial triangle, D is a vertex of DEF, so D is on the circumcircle). Similarly, E and F are on the circumcircle. So BD is a line from B to D, which is on the circumcircle. So the intersection points of BD with the circumcircle of DEF would be D and G. Similarly, AE intersects the circumcircle at E and H, and AF intersects it at F and J.\n\nTherefore, points G, H, J are the second intersections of the medians BD, AE, AF with the circumcircle of DEF. So G is on BD, H is on AE, J is on AF, each being the other intersection point apart from D, E, F.",
    "Then, the points G, D, E, H, J, F divide the circumcircle into six minor arcs. So starting from G, going around the circle, we have arcs GD, DE, EH, HJ, JF, FG? Wait, but the problem statement says \"the points G, D, E, H, J, and F divide the circumcircle of DEF into six minor arcs\". So the order is G, D, E, H, J, F. So the arcs would be from G to D, D to E, E to H, H to J, J to F, and F to G. So the arcs are GD, DE, EH, HJ, JF, FG. Wait, but the problem mentions DE, HJ, FG. So DE is one of the arcs, HJ is another, FG is another. Then the sum is DE + 2*HJ + 3*FG. So need to find the measures of these arcs and compute that weighted sum.\n\nTo approach this, perhaps I need to find the measure of each arc DE, HJ, FG. Then multiply HJ by 2, FG by 3, and sum them all with DE. So first, let's think about how to find these arc measures.\n\nSince DEF is the medial triangle, its circumcircle is the nine-point circle of ABC. The nine-point circle has a radius half of the circumradius of ABC. But maybe instead of using nine-point circle properties, I can compute angles in triangle DEF and relate them to the arcs.",
    "Alternatively, maybe using cyclic quadrilaterals properties or inscribed angles. Since all points are on the circumcircle of DEF, the arcs correspond to central angles. So if I can find the central angles corresponding to DE, HJ, FG, then their measures in degrees would be equal to those central angles.",
    "Alternatively, maybe using coordinates. Assign coordinates to triangle ABC, compute coordinates of D, E, F, then find the equation of the circumcircle of DEF, find intersections G, H, J with BD, AE, AF, then compute the arcs. But that might be complicated, but perhaps manageable.",
    "Alternatively, using angle chasing. Since DEF is the medial triangle, perhaps some angles can be related to the original triangle ABC.",
    "First, let me recall that in a medial triangle, each side is parallel to the corresponding side of the original triangle and half its length. So DE is parallel to AB, EF is parallel to BC, FD is parallel to AC. Wait, DEF is the medial triangle, so DE connects midpoints D and E of BC and AC, so DE is parallel to AB and half its length. Similarly for the others.",
    "Given that, maybe angles in DEF can be related to angles in ABC. Let's see. Since DE is parallel to AB, angle at D in DEF would be equal to angle at B in ABC? Wait, no. Wait, DEF has sides parallel to AB, BC, AC? Wait, DE is parallel to AB, EF is parallel to BC, FD is parallel to AC. Therefore, angles in DEF correspond to angles in ABC but maybe rotated or something. Wait, angle at D in DEF: since DE is parallel to AB and DF is parallel to AC, then angle at D is equal to angle BAC? Wait, because DE is parallel to AB and DF is parallel to AC, so the angle between DE and DF at D would be the same as the angle between AB and AC at A, which is angle BAC = 84 degrees. Similarly, angle at E would be equal to angle ABC = 60 degrees, and angle at F would be equal to angle ACB = 36 degrees. Therefore, triangle DEF has angles 84°, 60°, 36°, same as ABC. Wait, but DEF is the medial triangle, so it's similar to ABC but scaled by 1/2. Wait, but angles remain the same. So DEF is similar to ABC with a ratio of 1:2. Therefore, angles in DEF are equal to angles in ABC, which are 84°, 60°, 36°. Therefore, the circumcircle of DEF has triangle DEF inscribed in it with those angles.\n\nBut wait, DEF is similar to ABC but scaled down. Therefore, the circumradius of DEF would be half the circumradius of ABC. But maybe we don't need the actual circumradius, but the arc measures. Since in the circumcircle of DEF, the arcs DE, HJ, FG correspond to certain central angles.\n\nWait, arc DE is the arc between D and E on the circumcircle of DEF. Since DEF is a triangle inscribed in its circumcircle, the arc DE would correspond to twice the angle at F in triangle DEF. Because in a circle, the central angle over an arc is twice the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc. So angle at F is 36°, so arc DE would be 72°. Similarly, arc EF would be 2* angle at D = 2*84°=168°, and arc FD would be 2* angle at E = 2*60°=120°. Wait, but DEF's angles are 84°, 60°, 36°, so arcs opposite those angles would be 2* those angles. Wait, no. Wait, in any triangle inscribed in a circle, the central angle over an arc is twice the opposite angle. Wait, if we have triangle DEF inscribed in a circle, then the arc DE is opposite angle F, so the central angle for arc DE is 2* angle F = 2*36°=72°, so arc DE is 72°. Similarly, arc EF would be 2* angle D = 2*84°=168°, and arc FD is 2* angle E = 2*60°=120°. Wait, but adding up 72+168+120=360°, which is correct. So arcs DE=72°, EF=168°, FD=120°. But in the problem, the points G, D, E, H, J, F divide the circle into six arcs. So the original arcs DE, EF, FD are each split into smaller arcs by points G, H, J.",
    "Wait, but DEF is the medial triangle, so D, E, F are fixed. Then G is the intersection of BD with the circumcircle of DEF, other than D. Similarly, H is the intersection of AE with the circumcircle, other than E, and J is the intersection of AF with the circumcircle, other than F. So BD, AE, AF are medians of ABC, but in DEF's circumcircle, which is the nine-point circle.",
    "Wait, but DEF's circumcircle is the nine-point circle, so it should pass through the midpoints of the sides (which are D, E, F), the feet of the altitudes, and the midpoints of the segments from each vertex to the orthocenter. But maybe in this problem, since ABC has angles 84°, 60°, 36°, which isn't a right triangle or anything standard, so perhaps coordinates would help.",
    "Alternatively, maybe using complex numbers. Assign coordinates to ABC, compute DEF, compute the circumcircle, find intersections G, H, J, then compute the arcs.\n\nLet me try coordinate geometry. Let's place triangle ABC in coordinate plane in a convenient way.\n\nLet me set vertex B at the origin (0,0). Let me let BC lie along the x-axis. Let me denote BC as side a, AC as side b, AB as side c. But maybe assigning coordinates based on angles.\n\nGiven angles at A, B, C: 84°, 60°, 36°. Let me denote vertex B at (0,0), vertex C at (c,0), vertex A somewhere in the plane. Then angle at B is 60°, angle at C is 36°, angle at A is 84°. Let's use the Law of Sines to find side lengths.\n\nLaw of Sines: In triangle ABC, a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C.\n\nWait, sides opposite angles: side a is BC, opposite angle A (84°); side b is AC, opposite angle B (60°); side c is AB, opposite angle C (36°).\n\nSo, a / sin 84° = b / sin 60° = c / sin 36°.\n\nLet me compute the ratios. Let me denote the circumradius of ABC as R. Then a = 2R sin A, etc. But maybe instead, assign a specific length for simplicity.\n\nLet me assume that the circumradius of ABC is 1 for simplicity. Then:\n\na = BC = 2R sin A = 2*1*sin 84° ≈ 2*0.9945 ≈ 1.989\n\nb = AC = 2R sin B = 2*1*sin 60° ≈ 2*(√3/2) ≈ 1.732\n\nc = AB = 2R sin C = 2*1*sin 36° ≈ 2*0.5878 ≈ 1.1756\n\nBut maybe instead of assuming R=1, let's assign BC to be of length 1. Then using Law of Sines:\n\na = BC = 1 = 2R sin 84° ⇒ R = 1 / (2 sin 84°)\n\nThen other sides:\n\nb = AC = 2R sin 60° = (1 / sin 84°) * sin 60° ≈ (1 / 0.9945) * 0.8660 ≈ 0.8707\n\nc = AB = 2R sin 36° = (1 / sin 84°) * sin 36° ≈ (1 / 0.9945) * 0.5878 ≈ 0.591\n\nBut maybe working with actual coordinates would be messy with these lengths. Alternatively, let's assign coordinates more cleverly.\n\nLet me place point B at (0,0), point C at (1,0). Then we need to find coordinates of point A such that angle at B is 60°, angle at C is 36°, and angle at A is 84°. Let's compute coordinates of A.\n\nUsing Law of Sines:\n\nBC / sin A = AB / sin C = AC / sin B\n\nGiven BC = 1, angle A = 84°, angle B = 60°, angle C = 36°.\n\nThus:\n\nAB = (BC * sin C) / sin A = (1 * sin 36°) / sin 84° ≈ (0.5878) / 0.9945 ≈ 0.591\n\nAC = (BC * sin B) / sin A = (1 * sin 60°) / sin 84° ≈ (0.8660) / 0.9945 ≈ 0.8707\n\nSo coordinates of A can be found using these distances. Let me compute coordinates.\n\nSince point B is at (0,0), point C is at (1,0). Let me place point A somewhere in the plane. Let me denote coordinates of A as (x,y). Then distance AB = sqrt(x² + y²) ≈ 0.591, distance AC = sqrt((x - 1)² + y²) ≈ 0.8707.\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\nx² + y² ≈ (0.591)² ≈ 0.349\n\n(x - 1)² + y² ≈ (0.8707)² ≈ 0.758\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n(x - 1)² + y² - x² - y² ≈ 0.758 - 0.349 ⇒ (x² - 2x + 1) - x² ≈ 0.409 ⇒ -2x + 1 ≈ 0.409 ⇒ -2x ≈ -0.591 ⇒ x ≈ 0.2955\n\nThen plugging back into x² + y² ≈ 0.349:\n\n(0.2955)^2 + y² ≈ 0.349 ⇒ 0.0873 + y² ≈ 0.349 ⇒ y² ≈ 0.2617 ⇒ y ≈ 0.5116\n\nSo coordinates of A are approximately (0.2955, 0.5116). Let me verify angles.\n\nUsing coordinates, angle at B (0,0) between BA and BC. Vector BA is (0.2955, 0.5116), vector BC is (1,0). The angle between BA and BC can be calculated using dot product:\n\ncos(theta) = (BA . BC) / (|BA| |BC|) = (0.2955 * 1 + 0.5116 * 0) / (0.591 * 1) ≈ 0.2955 / 0.591 ≈ 0.500 ⇒ theta ≈ 60°, which matches. Similarly, angle at C can be computed.\n\nVector CB is (-1,0), vector CA is (0.2955 - 1, 0.5116 - 0) = (-0.7045, 0.5116). The angle at C is between vectors CB and CA.\n\nDot product: (-1)(-0.7045) + 0*0.5116 = 0.7045. |CB| = 1, |CA| ≈ 0.8707.\n\ncos(theta) = 0.7045 / (1 * 0.8707) ≈ 0.7045 / 0.8707 ≈ 0.809, so theta ≈ 36°, which matches. Good.\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nB: (0,0)\n\nC: (1,0)\n\nA: approximately (0.2955, 0.5116)\n\nNow, midpoints D, E, F.\n\nD is midpoint of BC: ((0+1)/2, (0+0)/2) = (0.5, 0)\n\nE is midpoint of AC: ((0.2955 + 1)/2, (0.5116 + 0)/2) ≈ (0.64775, 0.2558)\n\nF is midpoint of AB: ((0 + 0.2955)/2, (0 + 0.5116)/2) ≈ (0.14775, 0.2558)\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nD: (0.5, 0)\n\nE: ≈ (0.64775, 0.2558)\n\nF: ≈ (0.14775, 0.2558)\n\nNow, DEF is the medial triangle with vertices at D, E, F. Let's compute the circumcircle of DEF.",
    "First, find the circumcircle equation passing through D(0.5,0), E(0.64775,0.2558), F(0.14775,0.2558).\n\nTo find the circumcircle, we can find the perpendicular bisectors of DE and DF and find their intersection.\n\nFirst, compute midpoint of DE: midpoint between D(0.5,0) and E(0.64775,0.2558):\n\nx: (0.5 + 0.64775)/2 ≈ 1.14775/2 ≈ 0.573875\n\ny: (0 + 0.2558)/2 ≈ 0.1279\n\nSlope of DE: (0.2558 - 0)/(0.64775 - 0.5) ≈ 0.2558 / 0.14775 ≈ 1.730\n\nSo slope of DE is approximately 1.730, so the perpendicular bisector will have slope -1/1.730 ≈ -0.578.\n\nEquation of perpendicular bisector of DE: passes through midpoint (0.573875, 0.1279) with slope -0.578.\n\nSimilarly, compute midpoint of DF: midpoint between D(0.5,0) and F(0.14775,0.2558):\n\nx: (0.5 + 0.14775)/2 ≈ 0.64775/2 ≈ 0.323875\n\ny: (0 + 0.2558)/2 ≈ 0.1279\n\nSlope of DF: (0.2558 - 0)/(0.14775 - 0.5) ≈ 0.2558 / (-0.35225) ≈ -0.726\n\nSo slope of DF is approximately -0.726, so perpendicular bisector slope is reciprocal and opposite: 1/0.726 ≈ 1.377.\n\nEquation of perpendicular bisector of DF: passes through midpoint (0.323875, 0.1279) with slope ≈1.377.\n\nNow, find intersection of these two perpendicular bisectors to get the circumcircle center.\n\nFirst, write equations:\n\nFor DE's bisector: y - 0.1279 = -0.578(x - 0.573875)\n\nFor DF's bisector: y - 0.1279 = 1.377(x - 0.323875)\n\nSet them equal:\n\n-0.578(x - 0.573875) + 0.1279 = 1.377(x - 0.323875) + 0.1279\n\nSubtract 0.1279 from both sides:\n\n-0.578(x - 0.573875) = 1.377(x - 0.323875)\n\nMultiply out:\n\n-0.578x + 0.578*0.573875 ≈ -0.578x + 0.3317 = 1.377x - 1.377*0.323875 ≈ 1.377x - 0.4463\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-0.578x + 0.3317 -1.377x + 0.4463 = 0 ⇒ (-0.578 -1.377)x + (0.3317 +0.4463) ≈ (-1.955)x + 0.778 = 0\n\nThus, x ≈ 0.778 / 1.955 ≈ 0.398\n\nThen plug x ≈0.398 into DE's bisector equation:\n\ny ≈ -0.578*(0.398 -0.573875) +0.1279 ≈ -0.578*(-0.175875) +0.1279 ≈ 0.1017 +0.1279 ≈ 0.2296\n\nSo circumcircle center is approximately (0.398, 0.2296). Let's verify the distance to D, E, F.\n\nDistance to D(0.5,0):\n\nsqrt((0.5 -0.398)^2 + (0 -0.2296)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.0104 + 0.0527) ≈ sqrt(0.0631) ≈0.2512\n\nDistance to E(0.64775,0.2558):\n\nsqrt((0.64775 -0.398)^2 + (0.2558 -0.2296)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.0623 + 0.0007) ≈ sqrt(0.063) ≈0.251\n\nDistance to F(0.14775,0.2558):\n\nsqrt((0.14775 -0.398)^2 + (0.2558 -0.2296)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.0627 +0.0007) ≈ sqrt(0.0634)≈0.2518\n\nSo approximately equal radii (~0.251), which is consistent. So the circumradius is approximately 0.251 units in this coordinate system.\n\nNow, need to find points G, H, J where BD, AE, AF intersect the circumcircle of DEF again.\n\nFirst, BD is the median from B(0,0) to D(0.5,0). Wait, BD is the line from (0,0) to (0.5,0), which is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (0.5,0). But D is already on the circumcircle of DEF, so the other intersection point G is another point on BD and the circumcircle. But BD is the x-axis from (0,0) to (0.5,0). The circumcircle of DEF has center at approximately (0.398,0.2296) and radius ~0.251. So BD is the x-axis from (0,0) to (0.5,0). Let's parametrize BD: points on BD are (t,0) where t ranges from 0 to 0.5. We need to find another intersection point G of BD with the circumcircle, apart from D(0.5,0).\n\nSo substitute y=0 into the circumcircle equation. The circumcircle equation is (x -0.398)^2 + (y -0.2296)^2 ≈ (0.251)^2 ≈0.063.\n\nSetting y=0:\n\n(x -0.398)^2 + (0 -0.2296)^2 ≈0.063 ⇒ (x -0.398)^2 +0.0527 ≈0.063 ⇒ (x -0.398)^2 ≈0.0103 ⇒ x -0.398 ≈±0.1015 ⇒ x≈0.398±0.1015 ⇒ x≈0.4995 or x≈0.2965\n\nBut BD is from (0,0) to (0.5,0). So x ranges from 0 to 0.5. The solutions are x≈0.4995 (~0.5) and x≈0.2965. Since D is at (0.5,0), the other intersection point G is at approximately (0.2965,0).\n\nTherefore, G is at approximately (0.2965,0).\n\nSimilarly, find H on AE and J on AF.\n\nFirst, AE: median from A(0.2955,0.5116) to E(0.64775,0.2558). Let's parametrize AE.\n\nParametric equations: from A to E. Let parameter t go from 0 to 1.\n\nx(t) = 0.2955 + t*(0.64775 -0.2955) ≈0.2955 + t*0.35225\n\ny(t) =0.5116 + t*(0.2558 -0.5116) ≈0.5116 - t*0.2558\n\nWe need to find intersection H of AE with circumcircle of DEF, other than E.\n\nE is at t=1: (0.64775,0.2558). So H is another intersection point. Let's substitute x(t), y(t) into the circumcircle equation:\n\n(x -0.398)^2 + (y -0.2296)^2 ≈0.063\n\nSubstitute:\n\n(0.2955 +0.35225t -0.398)^2 + (0.5116 -0.2558t -0.2296)^2 ≈0.063\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-0.1025 +0.35225t)^2 + (0.282 -0.2558t)^2 ≈0.063\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (-0.1025 +0.35225t)^2 ≈ (0.35225t -0.1025)^2 ≈ (0.35225t)^2 -2*0.35225t*0.1025 +0.1025² ≈0.124t² -0.0723t +0.0105\n\nSecond term: (0.282 -0.2558t)^2 ≈ (-0.2558t +0.282)^2 ≈ (0.2558t)^2 -2*0.2558t*0.282 +0.282² ≈0.0654t² -0.1435t +0.0795\n\nSumming both terms:\n\n0.124t² -0.0723t +0.0105 +0.0654t² -0.1435t +0.0795 ≈ (0.124+0.0654)t² + (-0.0723 -0.1435)t + (0.0105 +0.0795) ≈0.1894t² -0.2158t +0.09\n\nSet equal to 0.063:\n\n0.1894t² -0.2158t +0.09 =0.063 ⇒0.1894t² -0.2158t +0.027=0\n\nSolve quadratic equation:\n\nt = [0.2158 ± sqrt(0.2158² -4*0.1894*0.027)] / (2*0.1894)\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n0.2158² ≈0.0466\n\n4*0.1894*0.027≈0.0204\n\nDiscriminant ≈0.0466 -0.0204≈0.0262\n\nsqrt(0.0262)≈0.1618\n\nThus,\n\nt≈[0.2158 ±0.1618]/0.3788\n\nFirst solution: (0.2158 +0.1618)/0.3788≈0.3776/0.3788≈0.996 ≈1.0\n\nSecond solution: (0.2158 -0.1618)/0.3788≈0.054/0.3788≈0.1426\n\nSo t≈1.0 corresponds to point E, so the other intersection H is at t≈0.1426.\n\nThus, coordinates of H:\n\nx≈0.2955 +0.35225*0.1426≈0.2955 +0.0502≈0.3457\n\ny≈0.5116 -0.2558*0.1426≈0.5116 -0.0365≈0.4751\n\nSo H is approximately (0.3457,0.4751)\n\nSimilarly, find J on AF. AF is the median from A(0.2955,0.5116) to F(0.14775,0.2558). Parametrize AF:\n\nx(t) =0.2955 + t*(0.14775 -0.2955)=0.2955 -0.14775t\n\ny(t)=0.5116 + t*(0.2558 -0.5116)=0.5116 -0.2558t\n\nFind intersection J with circumcircle of DEF other than F.\n\nF is at t=1: (0.14775,0.2558). So J is the other intersection point.\n\nSubstitute x(t), y(t) into circumcircle equation:\n\n(x -0.398)^2 + (y -0.2296)^2 ≈0.063\n\nSubstitute:\n\n(0.2955 -0.14775t -0.398)^2 + (0.5116 -0.2558t -0.2296)^2 ≈0.063\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-0.1025 -0.14775t)^2 + (0.282 -0.2558t)^2 ≈0.063\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (-0.1025 -0.14775t)^2 ≈ (0.14775t +0.1025)^2 ≈0.0218t² +0.0303t +0.0105\n\nSecond term: (0.282 -0.2558t)^2 ≈ same as before ≈0.0654t² -0.1435t +0.0795\n\nSumming:\n\n0.0218t² +0.0303t +0.0105 +0.0654t² -0.1435t +0.0795 ≈(0.0218+0.0654)t² + (0.0303 -0.1435)t + (0.0105 +0.0795)≈0.0872t² -0.1132t +0.09\n\nSet equal to 0.063:\n\n0.0872t² -0.1132t +0.09 =0.063 ⇒0.0872t² -0.1132t +0.027=0\n\nSolve quadratic:\n\nt = [0.1132 ± sqrt(0.1132² -4*0.0872*0.027)] / (2*0.0872)\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n0.1132²≈0.0128\n\n4*0.0872*0.027≈0.00942\n\nDiscriminant≈0.0128 -0.00942≈0.00338\n\nsqrt(0.00338)≈0.0581\n\nThus,\n\nt≈[0.1132 ±0.0581]/0.1744\n\nFirst solution: (0.1132 +0.0581)/0.1744≈0.1713/0.1744≈0.982≈1.0\n\nSecond solution: (0.1132 -0.0581)/0.1744≈0.0551/0.1744≈0.316\n\nSo t≈0.316 corresponds to point J.\n\nThus, coordinates of J:\n\nx≈0.2955 -0.14775*0.316≈0.2955 -0.0467≈0.2488\n\ny≈0.5116 -0.2558*0.316≈0.5116 -0.0809≈0.4307\n\nSo J is approximately (0.2488,0.4307)\n\nNow, we have coordinates of G(0.2965,0), H(0.3457,0.4751), J(0.2488,0.4307), along with D(0.5,0), E(0.64775,0.2558), F(0.14775,0.2558) on the circumcircle of DEF.\n\nNow, need to find the measures of arcs DE, HJ, FG.",
    "First, arc DE: from D(0.5,0) to E(0.64775,0.2558). Since DEF is a triangle inscribed in the circle, arc DE corresponds to the central angle over DE, which we previously thought was 72°, but in reality, since DEF's angles are 84°, 60°, 36°, but the central angles would be double those. Wait, but DEF is inscribed in the circle, so the central angles over the sides are twice the inscribed angles. So arc DE is opposite angle F in DEF, which is 36°, so central angle 72°, hence arc DE is 72°. But wait, according to coordinates, maybe we can compute the actual central angle.",
    "Alternatively, since DEF's angles correspond to arcs, but with points G, H, J added, the circle is divided into six arcs: GD, DE, EH, HJ, JF, FG. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the points G, D, E, H, J, F divide the circle into six arcs. So order is G, D, E, H, J, F around the circle.",
    "Wait, but how are these points arranged around the circle? Let's figure out their positions.\n\nGiven the coordinates:\n\nG: (0.2965,0)\n\nD: (0.5,0)\n\nE: (0.64775,0.2558)\n\nH: (0.3457,0.4751)\n\nJ: (0.2488,0.4307)\n\nF: (0.14775,0.2558)\n\nConnecting these points around the circumcircle. Let's compute their angles relative to the center (0.398,0.2296).\n\nTo find the order, compute the angle each point makes with respect to the center.\n\nFor each point (x,y), compute the angle θ = arctan2(y - center_y, x - center_x)\n\nCenter: (0.398,0.2296)\n\nCompute angles:\n\nG: (0.2965,0)\n\nVector from center: (0.2965 -0.398, 0 -0.2296) ≈ (-0.1015, -0.2296)\n\nAngle: arctan2(-0.2296, -0.1015) which is in the third quadrant. The reference angle is arctan(0.2296/0.1015)≈arctan(2.262)≈66°. So angle≈180° +66°=246°\n\nD: (0.5,0)\n\nVector: (0.5 -0.398, 0 -0.2296)=(0.102, -0.2296)\n\nAngle: arctan2(-0.2296,0.102). This is in the fourth quadrant. Reference angle arctan(0.2296/0.102)≈arctan(2.25)≈66°, so angle≈360° -66°=294°\n\nE: (0.64775,0.2558)\n\nVector: (0.64775 -0.398, 0.2558 -0.2296)=(0.24975,0.0262)\n\nAngle: arctan2(0.0262,0.24975). Since both positive, quadrant I. Approximate angle≈arctan(0.0262/0.24975)≈arctan(0.105)≈6°\n\nH: (0.3457,0.4751)\n\nVector: (0.3457 -0.398,0.4751 -0.2296)=(-0.0523,0.2455)\n\nAngle: arctan2(0.2455,-0.0523). This is in the second quadrant. Reference angle arctan(0.2455/0.0523)≈arctan(4.69)≈78°, so angle≈180° -78°=102°\n\nJ: (0.2488,0.4307)\n\nVector: (0.2488 -0.398,0.4307 -0.2296)=(-0.1492,0.2011)\n\nAngle: arctan2(0.2011,-0.1492). Second quadrant. Reference angle arctan(0.2011/0.1492)≈arctan(1.348)≈53.5°, so angle≈180° -53.5°=126.5°\n\nF: (0.14775,0.2558)\n\nVector: (0.14775 -0.398,0.2558 -0.2296)=(-0.25025,0.0262)\n\nAngle: arctan2(0.0262,-0.25025). Second quadrant. Reference angle arctan(0.0262/0.25025)≈arctan(0.105)≈6°, so angle≈180° -6°=174°\n\nSo angles in degrees:\n\nG: ~246°\n\nD: ~294°\n\nE: ~6°\n\nH: ~102°\n\nJ: ~126.5°\n\nF: ~174°\n\nNow, arrange these points in order around the circle:\n\nStart from G at 246°, then D at 294°, E at 6°, H at 102°, J at 126.5°, F at 174°, and back to G.\n\nWait, but angles are modulo 360°, so E is at 6°, which is just past 0°. So ordering from G (246°) going clockwise: G (246°), D (294°), E (6°), H (102°), J (126.5°), F (174°), back to G.\n\nTherefore, arcs:\n\nGD: from G to D (246° to 294°), arc length 294 -246=48°\n\nDE: D to E (294° to 6°), arc length (360 -294) +6=72°\n\nEH: E to H (6° to102°), arc length 96°\n\nHJ: H to J (102° to126.5°), arc length24.5°\n\nJF: J to F (126.5° to174°), arc length47.5°\n\nFG: F to G (174° to246°), arc length72°",
    "Wait, let's verify:\n\nGD: 294 -246=48°\n\nDE: 6 -294, but since it's a circle, DE is from 294° to6°, which is 360 -294 +6=72°\n\nEH:102 -6=96°\n\nHJ:126.5 -102=24.5°\n\nJF:174 -126.5=47.5°\n\nFG:246 -174=72°\n\nTotal arcs:48+72+96+24.5+47.5+72=360°, correct.\n\nSo according to this, arc DE is72°, arc HJ is24.5°, arc FG is72°. Then the problem asks for DE +2*HJ +3*FG =72 +2*24.5 +3*72=72 +49 +216=337°. But this contradicts the approximate calculation here. Wait, but this is based on approximate coordinates, so maybe there are errors due to rounding.\n\nBut according to the initial assumption based on triangle DEF's angles, arc DE should be72°, which matches the coordinate calculation here. Similarly, arc FG is72°, which also matches. Arc HJ is24.5°, but according to approximate coordinates. But maybe in reality, HJ is30°, FG is60°, DE is72°, sum is72 +2*30 +3*60=72+60+180=312. Hmm, but according to coordinates, HJ is24.5°, FG is72°, which gives 72+49+216=337. But this seems messy.",
    "Alternatively, maybe there is symmetry or angle chasing that can give exact values.",
    "Wait, but DEF's circumcircle arcs: DE is72°, which is exact because angle F is36°, central angle is72°. Similarly, EF is168°, FD is120°. But when we add points G, H, J, these arcs are divided into smaller arcs. For example, arc DE is72°, which is between D and E. But according to the coordinate calculation, DE is72°, which is correct. Then arc EH is96°, HJ is24.5°, JF is47.5°, FG is72°, GD is48°, etc. But perhaps these arcs can be calculated using properties instead of coordinates.",
    "Alternatively, since DEF's circumcircle is the nine-point circle, and G, H, J are midpoints or something else. Wait, but G is the intersection of BD (a median) with the nine-point circle, other than D. Similarly for H and J.",
    "Alternatively, since DEF is the medial triangle, BD is a median of ABC, and in the nine-point circle, the midpoints of the sides, the feet of the altitudes, and the midpoints of AH, BH, CH (where H is orthocenter) lie on it. But maybe G, H, J are midpoints of certain segments? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using power of a point. For point B, which lies outside the nine-point circle. The power of B with respect to DEF's circumcircle is equal to the product of distances from B to the intersection points G and D. Similarly for other points.",
    "But BD is a median, so BD is divided by D into segments BD and DG. Wait, BD is from B to D, which is midpoint of BC. So BD is a median. The power of point B with respect to the nine-point circle is equal to BG * BD = BH * BE = BJ * BF, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since DEF is the medial triangle, coordinates might be necessary, but my approximate calculation led to DE=72°, HJ≈24.5°, FG=72°, sum≈72 +49 +216=337°, but this seems messy. However, since DEF's angles are known, and arcs DE, EF, FD are 72°,168°,120°, but with points G,H,J inserted, dividing those arcs into smaller ones.\n\nWait, arc DE is72°, which is between D and E. Then arc EH is96°, HJ is24.5°, JF is47.5°, FG is72°, GD is48°, and so on. But perhaps there's a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, since G is on BD, which is a median, and DEF is the medial triangle, maybe BG is equal to GD? Wait, BD is a median of ABC, D is midpoint of BC. In DEF's circumcircle, D is a point on the circle. G is another intersection point. If BD is a median, and DEF is the medial triangle, then perhaps BG * GD = power of B with respect to the circle.\n\nPower of point B with respect to DEF's circumcircle: |BT|² - r², where BT is distance from B to center T.\n\nBut maybe compute it as BG * BD = power of B.\n\nGiven center at (0.398,0.2296), distance from B(0,0) to center:\n\nsqrt(0.398² +0.2296²)≈sqrt(0.1584 +0.0527)≈sqrt(0.2111)≈0.4595\n\nPower of B: (0.4595)² - (0.251)²≈0.211 -0.063≈0.148\n\nBut BG * BD = BG * 0.5 (since BD is length 0.5 in our coordinate system where BC=1). So BG *0.5≈0.148 ⇒ BG≈0.296. Which matches our coordinate calculation where G is at (0.2965,0), so BG≈0.2965, which is≈0.296. So this checks out.\n\nSimilarly, power of point A with respect to the circle: AH * AE = AJ * AF.\n\nBut this might not directly help with arc measures.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps noting that arcs FG and GD are related. In the coordinate calculation, FG was72°, but according to the problem statement, the arcs are DE, HJ, FG. Wait, DE is72°, HJ is24.5°, FG is72°, sum is72 +2*24.5 +3*72=72 +49 +216=337°, but this is likely incorrect due to coordinate approximation.",
    "Alternatively, maybe there's an elegant answer. The problem asks for DE + 2*HJ + 3*FG. Since DE, HJ, FG are arcs, perhaps their measures are related to the angles in the original triangle or the medial triangle.\n\nGiven that DEF has angles 84°,60°,36°, the arcs opposite these angles are 2* those angles: 168°,120°,72°. So arc DE is72°, arc EF is168°, arc FD is120°. But the points G, H, J divide these arcs into smaller ones.\n\nFor example, arc FD is120°, which is from F to D. But in our ordering, arc FG is72°, GD is48°, summing to120°. Similarly, arc EF is168°, which is split into EH (96°) and HJ (24.5°) and JF (47.5°)? Wait, no, EF is from E to F, but in the circle with points ordered G,D,E,H,J,F, arc EF would be from E to F passing through H and J? Wait, no. The arcs are between consecutive points: GD, DE, EH, HJ, JF, FG.\n\nWait, arc DE is72°, which is part of the original arc DE in DEF's circumcircle. Then arc EH is96°, which is part of the original arc EF (168°). Then arc HJ is24.5°, which is part of arc EF. Then arc JF is47.5°, which is part of arc FD (120°). Arc FG is72°, which is part of arc FD. Arc GD is48°, which is part of arc GD.",
    "Wait, this is getting messy. Maybe instead of relying on approximate coordinates, think about symmetries or use exact angle relations.\n\nGiven that DEF is similar to ABC with angles 84°,60°,36°, so the arcs between D,E,F are 2* those angles:72°,120°,168°. Now, inserting points G,H,J which are intersections of medians with the circumcircle.\n\nIn triangle ABC, the medians intersect at the centroid, which divides each median into 2:1. But DEF is the medial triangle, so its centroid coincides with the centroid of ABC. But the nine-point circle center is the midpoint between the circumcenter and orthocenter. Hmm, maybe not helpful here.",
    "Alternatively, since DEF is the medial triangle, the nine-point circle (its circumcircle) also contains the midpoints of the sides, the feet of the altitudes, and the midpoints of AH, BH, CH where H is orthocenter. But unless we know the positions of the orthocenter or circumradius, this might not help.",
    "Alternatively, consider triangle DEF and points G,H,J. Since G is on BD, which is a median of ABC, and D is midpoint of BC. Maybe in triangle DEF, line BD is a symmedian or something? Not sure.",
    "Alternatively, use the fact that DEF is similar to ABC, so the arcs DE, EF, FD correspond to angles 72°,168°,120°. When we add points G,H,J, which are midpoints or something else, the arcs get divided proportionally.",
    "Wait, but DEF's sides are parallel to ABC's sides. DE is parallel to AB, so the arc DE in DEF's circumcircle corresponds to AB in ABC's circumcircle. But ABC's angles are 84°,60°,36°, so the arc AB in ABC's circumcircle would be 2*36°=72°, which is the same as arc DE in DEF's circumcircle. Similarly, arc BC in ABC's circumcircle is 2*84°=168°, which corresponds to arc EF in DEF's circumcircle, and arc AC is 2*60°=120°, corresponding to arc FD in DEF's circumcircle.\n\nNow, points G,H,J are intersections of medians with the nine-point circle. In ABC's circumcircle, the medians would intersect the circle at certain points, but DEF's circumcircle is different.",
    "Alternatively, since DEF is similar to ABC, rotated 180° and scaled by 1/2. So the arcs in DEF's circumcircle correspond directly to the arcs in ABC's circumcircle. Therefore, inserting points G,H,J in DEF's circumcircle corresponds to inserting points in ABC's circumcircle scaled down.",
    "But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since DEF's circumcircle is the nine-point circle, the arcs between midpoints correspond to halves of the arcs in ABC's circumcircle.",
    "Wait, if ABC's circumcircle has an arc AB of 72°, then the nine-point circle's arc DE (since DE is parallel to AB and half the length) would be the same 72°, but on a smaller circle. So the arc measures are preserved? Because angles subtended by the same chord in different circles depend on the radius, but arc length is proportional to radius. However, central angles are independent of radius. Wait, no. The central angle is the same regardless of radius, but the arc length is proportional to radius. However, in this case, DEF is similar to ABC scaled by 1/2, but rotated 180°, so the angles remain the same. Therefore, the central angles over corresponding arcs would be the same. So arc DE in DEF's circumcircle corresponds to arc AB in ABC's circumcircle, both subtending angles 72°. Therefore, arc DE is72°, arc HJ and FG need to be found.\n\nBut how?",
    "Alternatively, note that points G, H, J are midpoints of certain arcs. For example, if BD intersects the nine-point circle at G and D, and BD is a median, then perhaps G is the midpoint of arc GD or something. But without more information, it's hard to say.",
    "Alternatively, consider that in the nine-point circle, the points where the medians intersect the circle again (G, H, J) might correspond to midpoints of arcs. For example, in some cases, the Euler line intersects the nine-point circle at certain points, but I'm not sure.",
    "Alternatively, use complex numbers. Let me try that.\n\nLet me place the circumcircle of DEF as the unit circle for simplicity. Wait, but DEF has angles 84°,60°,36°, so its circumcircle can be considered as the unit circle with DEF inscribed.\n\nWait, if DEF is inscribed in the unit circle with angles 84°,60°,36°, then the arcs DE, EF, FD would be 72°,120°,168°, as central angles.\n\nBut how to relate points G,H,J?",
    "Alternatively, parametrize the circle and find where the medians intersect.",
    "But this might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps noticing that the required sum DE + 2*HJ +3*FG involves arcs that may add up to a multiple of 60°, given the angles in the problem.",
    "Wait, the original triangle has angles 84°,60°,36°, which sum to180°. The medial triangle DEF also has the same angles. The arcs DE=72°, HJ and FG to be determined. If HJ and FG are also multiples of 12°, maybe.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the sum is 360°, but DE +2*HJ +3*FG=72 +2x +3y=?\n\nAlternatively, since DEF's circumcircle is divided into six arcs:GD=48°, DE=72°, EH=96°, HJ=24.5°, JF=47.5°, FG=72°, totaling 360°. Then the problem wants DE +2*HJ +3*FG=72 +2*24.5 +3*72=72 +49 +216=337°, but this is approximate. However, the problem is likely expecting an exact answer, so my coordinate approach might have errors due to rounding.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps there's an elegant solution using the fact that the sum involves coefficients 1,2,3, which might hint that the total is 360°, but 72 +2x +3y=360°, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, the sum could be 180°, but 72 +2x +3y=180°, but need to find x and y.",
    "Alternatively, since DEF's circumcircle is the nine-point circle, which has some properties related to the original triangle's Euler line. However, without knowing specific details about triangle ABC's orthocenter or circumradius, this might not help.",
    "Wait, another thought: since DEF is the medial triangle, the nine-point circle's center is the nine-point center, which is the midpoint of the Euler line (between the orthocenter and circumcenter). If we can find the Euler line's orientation, maybe we can find some symmetry. But again, without specific coordinates, this is difficult.",
    "Alternatively, recall that in a nine-point circle, the midpoints of the sides, the feet of the altitudes, and the midpoints of the segments from each vertex to the orthocenter lie on the circle. If we can relate points G,H,J to these points, maybe they coincide with some known points. For example, if BD is a median, and the nine-point circle passes through the midpoint of BH, where H is the orthocenter. But unless we can find the orthocenter's location, this is tricky.",
    "Alternatively, maybe using trigonometric identities. Since the problem involves angles 84°,60°,36°, which are all multiples of 12°, perhaps there are some known sine or cosine values or symmetries.",
    "Wait, 84° is 60° +24°, 36° is 60° -24°, so maybe there's a relationship there. Alternatively, 84°, 60°,36° sum to 180°, but individually, they don't form any special triangles.",
    "Alternatively, note that 36° is related to the golden ratio, appearing in a regular pentagon, but 84° and60° don't directly relate.",
    "Alternatively, consider triangle ABC with angles 84°,60°,36°, construct its medial triangle DEF, then find the arcs. But perhaps there is a property I'm missing where the sum DE +2*HJ +3*FG equals 360°, but according to my approximate calculation, it's337°, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, it might be 360°, but need to check.\n\nWait, DE is72°, FG is72°, HJ is24.5°, so72 +2*24.5 +3*72=72 +49 +216=337°, which is23° less than360°, so probably not.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the arcs HJ and FG are related such that HJ is30° and FG is60°, making the sum72 +60 +180=312°, but this is speculation.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that in the nine-point circle, the angles subtended by the sides of the medial triangle are equal to the angles of the original triangle. Wait, DEF is similar to ABC, so angles are same, so arcs subtended by DEF's sides are twice the angles of DEF, which are same as ABC's angles. So arc DE is2*36°=72°, arc EF=2*84°=168°, arc FD=2*60°=120°. Then points G, H, J divide these arcs into smaller ones. For example, arc FD is120°, split into FG and GD. If FG is72°, GD is48°, as in coordinates. Then arc HJ is24.5°, which is part of arc EH=96°, which is part of arc EF=168°. So EH=96°, HJ=24.5°, JF=47.5°, summing to168°. Similarly, arc DE=72°, GD=48°, FG=72°, etc.",
    "But without exact values, it's hard to see. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that the sum is360°, but according to the approximate calculation, it's337°, which suggests that my coordinate method is missing something.",

    "Alternatively, maybe the answer is360°, but I need to verify.",
    "Wait, the problem states \"six minor arcs\", so each arc is less than180°. The sum DE +2*HJ +3*FG is a combination of some arcs multiplied by coefficients. If all arcs add up to360°, but weighted sum might exceed that. However, the problem doesn't state that the sum is360°, so it could be any value.",
    "Alternatively, maybe there's a clever angle chasing solution.\n\nSince DEF's circumcircle is the nine-point circle of ABC, and G, H, J are intersections of medians with this circle. Let's consider cyclic quadrilaterals or inscribed angles.\n\nFor example, consider point G on BD. Since D and G are on the nine-point circle, and BD is a median. Maybe some angles subtended by arcs can be related.",
    "Alternatively, note that DEF is the medial triangle, so lines BD, AE, AF are medians of ABC. In the nine-point circle, midpoints D, E, F are present. Points G, H, J are other intersections.",
    "Alternatively, consider that the nine-point circle passes through the midpoints of BH, CH, AH, where H is the orthocenter. If G is the midpoint of BH, then BG = GH, but without knowing H's position, this is unclear.",
    "Alternatively, use the fact that the nine-point circle has half the radius of the circumcircle. If ABC's circumradius is R, nine-point circle has R/2. But angles in the nine-point circle are the same as in the circumcircle, since central angles are independent of radius.",
    "Wait, in ABC's circumcircle, arc AB is2*angle ACB=2*36°=72°, which corresponds to arc DE in DEF's circumcircle. Similarly, arc BC in ABC's circumcircle is2*angle BAC=168°, corresponding to arc EF in DEF's circumcircle, and arc AC is2*angle ABC=120°, corresponding to arc FD in DEF's circumcircle.\n\nTherefore, arcs in DEF's circumcircle are same as arcs in ABC's circumcircle, just scaled down. Therefore, inserting points G,H,J which are intersections of medians (from ABC) with DEF's circumcircle. In ABC's circumcircle, medians would intersect the circumcircle at certain points, but DEF's circumcircle is different.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the arcs HJ and FG correspond to certain angles related to the original triangle. For example, since HJ is on the nine-point circle, maybe it corresponds to an arc related to angle BAC or something else.",
    "Alternatively, since DEF is the medial triangle, the nine-point circle's arcs are related to the Euler line or other triangle centers, but I don't see a direct relation.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck with approximate coordinates leading to an answer of approximately337°, but the problem likely has an exact answer, I must have missed something.",
    "Wait, another approach: since DEF is the medial triangle, the nine-point circle's center is the nine-point center, which is the midpoint between the circumcenter and orthocenter of ABC. If I can find the angles at the center corresponding to arcs DE, HJ, FG, maybe using symmetries or properties.\n\nAlternatively, note that the problem asks for DE +2*HJ +3*FG. If I can express these arcs in terms of the original triangle's angles or DEF's angles.\n\nGiven DEF's angles are84°,60°,36°, the arcs DE=72°, EH=2*angle at F=72°, wait no, that reasoning was for the original triangle.

For example, arc DE is72°, which remains as DE. Arc EF is168°, which is split into EH, HJ, JF. Arc FD is120°, split into FG, GD.",
    "Assuming that the points G, H, J trisect or bisect these arcs. For example, if G and J trisect arc FD (120°), then FG=GD=40°, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if BD, AE, AF are symmedians or something that split the arcs proportionally.",
    "Alternatively, since DEF is similar to ABC, and G, H, J are analogous to points in ABC's circumcircle. But without more information, this is unclear.",
    "Alternatively, think of the six arcs as corresponding to the angles in ABC. Since ABC has angles84°,60°,36°, summing to180°, and DEF's circumcircle arcs sum to360°, which is double. The sum DE +2*HJ +3*FG might relate to these angles multiplied by coefficients.",

    "Alternatively, think of the six arcs as GD, DE, EH, HJ, JF, FG. If DE=72°, FG=72°, and HJ=72°, then sum would be72 +2*72 +3*72=6*72=432°, which is over360°, so no.",
    "Alternatively, maybe each arc corresponds to an angle in the original triangle: DE=84°, HJ=60°, FG=36°, but converted to arcs by doubling. But DE is2*36°=72°, which is angle at C. So maybe HJ corresponds to angle at B (60°), so arc HJ=2*60°=120°, but in coordinates it was24.5°, conflicting.",

So:\n\n- BD intersects the circle at D and G, so G divides arc FD (120°) into FG and GD.\n\n- AE intersects the circle at E and H, so H divides arc EF (168°) into EH and HF.\n\n- AF intersects the circle at F and J, so J divides arc FD (120°) into FJ and JD.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the points are ordered G, D, E, H, J, F. So arcs are GD, DE, EH, HJ, JF, FG.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Arc GD is part of arc FD (120°). So FD is split into FG and GD by point J and G.",
    "Wait, no. If J is on AF, which intersects the circle at F and J, then AF splits arc FD into FJ and JD. But FD is from F to D, so AF intersects the circle at F and J, so J is on arc FD. Similarly, BD intersects the circle at D and G, so G is on arc FD. Therefore, arc FD is split into three parts: FJ, JG, GD? Wait, but according to the problem's order, the points are G, D, E, H, J, F. So after F comes G, but F is connected to G via arc FG. So FD is split into FJ, JG, GD? Not sure.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps each median intersects the circle at two points: BD at D and G, AE at E and H, AF at F and J. Therefore:\n\n- BD splits arc FD into FG and GD.\n\n- AE splits arc EF into EH and HF.\n\n- AF splits arc FD into FJ and JD.\n\nBut the exact measures depend on where G, H, J are located.",
    "Alternatively, using power of a point:\n\nFor point B, power with respect to DEF's circumcircle is BG * BD = BF * BA (wait, BF is a midpoint, BA is a side). Wait, no, power of a point B is equal to the product of distances from B to any two intersection points with the circle. Since BD intersects the circle at D and G, power of B is BG * BD = BP^2 - r^2, where BP is distance from B to center.\n\nBut without exact coordinates, this might not help.",
    "Alternatively, since DEF is similar to ABC, and BD, AE, AF are medians, the points G, H, J might divide the medians in a certain ratio, which translates to arc measures.\n\nIn the medial triangle DEF, the medians of ABC correspond to lines connecting vertices of ABC to midpoints, which are vertices of DEF. For example, BD connects B to D, which is a vertex of DEF. So BD is a line from B to D, where D is a vertex of DEF. The other intersection G is such that BG * BD = power of B.\n\nBut since DEF's circumradius is half of ABC's, and DEF's sides are half as long, but angles are the same.",

So it's possible that the answer is360°, but I need to verify.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Find DE + 2*HJ + 3*FG\". If each arc is a minor arc, meaning less than180°, and the weights are 1,2,3. If DE=72°, HJ=60°, FG=48°, then72 +120 +144=336°. Still not360°.",
