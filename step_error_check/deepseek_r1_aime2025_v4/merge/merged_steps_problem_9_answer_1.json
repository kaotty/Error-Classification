      "content": "\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the intersection point in the fourth quadrant between the original parabola y = x² - 4 and its image after rotating 60 degrees counterclockwise around the origin. Then, determine the y-coordinate of that point, which is given in the form (a - sqrt(b))/c, and find a + b + c where a, c are coprime. Alright, let's start breaking this down.\n\nFirst, the original parabola is y = x² - 4. That's a standard parabola shifted down by 4 units. Its vertex is at (0, -4), opening upwards. The image after rotating 60 degrees counterclockwise. So, I need to find the equation of the rotated parabola. Then, find where they intersect in the fourth quadrant.\n\nRotation of a curve involves rotating each point on the curve by the given angle. So, to find the equation of the rotated parabola, I can use rotation transformation formulas. Let me recall that when a point (x, y) is rotated counterclockwise by θ degrees around the origin, the new coordinates (x', y') are given by:\n\nx' = x cosθ - y sinθ\n\ny' = x sinθ + y cosθ\n\nSince we're rotating the original parabola, every point (x, y) on y = x² - 4 will be transformed to (x', y') using these equations. So, the image of the parabola after rotation should satisfy these equations with θ = 60 degrees.\n\nBut to find the equation of the rotated parabola, I need to express the original coordinates (x, y) in terms of the new coordinates (x', y'). Let me invert the rotation equations. Let's solve for x and y in terms of x' and y'.\n\nGiven:\n\nx' = x cosθ - y sinθ\n\ny' = x sinθ + y cosθ\n\nLet me write θ = 60°, so cosθ = 0.5, sinθ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.\n\nSo,\n\nx' = 0.5x - (sqrt(3)/2)y\n\ny' = (sqrt(3)/2)x + 0.5y\n\nWe can solve this system for x and y. Let's write it as:\n\n0.5x - (sqrt(3)/2)y = x'\n\n(sqrt(3)/2)x + 0.5y = y'\n\nLet me solve these equations using substitution or elimination. Let's multiply the first equation by 2 to eliminate denominators:\n\nx - sqrt(3)y = 2x'\n\nsqrt(3)x + y = 2y'\n\nNow, let's write equations:\n\n1) x - sqrt(3)y = 2x'\n\n2) sqrt(3)x + y = 2y'\n\nLet me solve equation 1 for x:\n\nx = 2x' + sqrt(3)y\n\nSubstitute this into equation 2:\n\nsqrt(3)(2x' + sqrt(3)y) + y = 2y'\n\nMultiply out:\n\n2 sqrt(3)x' + 3y + y = 2y'\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2 sqrt(3)x' + 4y = 2y'\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nsqrt(3)x' + 2y = y'",

      "content": "But wait, this seems messy. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, express x and y in terms of x' and y' using inverse rotation. Since rotation is a linear transformation, the inverse rotation is by -θ. So, θ = -60°, which would give:\n\nx = x' cosθ + y' sinθ\n\ny = -x' sinθ + y' cosθ\n\nWait, maybe that's easier. Let me check. Because rotating a point by θ gives (x', y'), so to get back (x, y), we rotate by -θ. So, yes, the inverse rotation matrix is [cosθ, sinθ; -sinθ, cosθ] for θ = 60°, but since we are rotating back by -60°, θ becomes -60°, so cos(-θ) = cosθ, sin(-θ) = -sinθ.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the direction. Let me verify. The original coordinates (x, y) rotated by 60° CCW gives (x', y'). So, to get (x, y) in terms of (x', y'), we need to rotate (x', y') by -60°, i.e., 60° clockwise.\n\nSo, the inverse transformation is:\n\nx = x' cos60° + y' sin60°\n\ny = -x' sin60° + y' cos60°\n\nYes, because rotating back by -60°.\n\nSo, substituting cos60° = 0.5, sin60° = sqrt(3)/2:\n\nx = 0.5 x' + (sqrt(3)/2) y'\n\ny = - (sqrt(3)/2) x' + 0.5 y'\n\nTherefore, the original parabola equation y = x² - 4 can be written in terms of the rotated coordinates (x', y') as:\n\ny = x² - 4\n\nBut substituting x and y from above:\n\n- (sqrt(3)/2) x' + 0.5 y' = [0.5 x' + (sqrt(3)/2) y']² - 4",

      "content": "So, that's the equation of the rotated parabola in terms of x' and y'. Therefore, to find intersections between original parabola and rotated parabola, we can set (x', y') equal to (x, y), because the intersection points are points that lie on both the original and rotated parabola. Wait, but actually, the rotated parabola is the image of the original parabola after rotation. So, a point (x, y) is on the original parabola if y = x² - 4. The same point, after rotation, would be (x', y'), which lies on the rotated parabola. However, the intersection points between original and rotated parabola are points that are on both parabolas. So, a point (X, Y) that is on the original parabola Y = X² - 4 and also on the rotated parabola. So, substituting (X, Y) into the rotated parabola's equation.\n\nBut since the rotated parabola is the image of the original parabola under rotation, the rotated parabola's equation can be written as the original equation transformed by rotation. Therefore, substituting the inverse rotation expressions into the original equation.\n\nWait, maybe another approach is better. Let me consider that a point (X, Y) lies on both the original parabola and its rotated image. Therefore, (X, Y) must satisfy Y = X² - 4, and also (X, Y) must be the image of some point (x, y) on the original parabola after rotation. But since (X, Y) is the image of (x, y) under rotation, then:\n\nX = x cos60° - y sin60°\n\nY = x sin60° + y cos60°\n\nBut since (x, y) is on the original parabola, y = x² - 4. Therefore, substituting y into the rotation equations:\n\nX = x * 0.5 - (x² - 4) * (sqrt(3)/2)\n\nY = x * (sqrt(3)/2) + (x² - 4) * 0.5\n\nBut since (X, Y) must also lie on the original parabola Y = X² - 4. Therefore, substituting X and Y from above into Y = X² - 4.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nx*(sqrt(3)/2) + (x² - 4)*0.5 = [0.5x - (sqrt(3)/2)(x² - 4)]² - 4\n\nThis equation relates x, which is the x-coordinate of the original parabola point that maps to the intersection point (X, Y). Solving this equation for x will give us the x-coordinate(s) of the original parabola that, when rotated, result in points (X, Y) that are also on the original parabola.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe manageable. Let's write it step by step.\n\nLeft-hand side (LHS) of the equation:\n\nY = (sqrt(3)/2)x + (0.5)(x² - 4)\n\nRight-hand side (RHS):\n\nX² - 4 = [0.5x - (sqrt(3)/2)(x² - 4)]² - 4\n\nTherefore, equate LHS and RHS:\n\n(sqrt(3)/2)x + (0.5)(x² - 4) = [0.5x - (sqrt(3)/2)(x² - 4)]² - 4\n\nLet me simplify both sides first.\n\nStarting with LHS:\n\nMultiply sqrt(3)/2 x + (x² - 4)/2\n\nSo, LHS = (sqrt(3)x + x² - 4)/2\n\nRHS: Let's compute the square term first.\n\nLet me denote A = 0.5x - (sqrt(3)/2)(x² - 4)\n\nThen, RHS = A² - 4\n\nCompute A:\n\nA = (1/2)x - (sqrt(3)/2)(x² - 4)\n\nSo, A = [x - sqrt(3)(x² - 4)] / 2\n\nTherefore, A² = [x - sqrt(3)(x² - 4)]² / 4\n\nExpanding the numerator:\n\n[x - sqrt(3)(x² - 4)]² = x² - 2x*sqrt(3)(x² - 4) + [sqrt(3)(x² - 4)]²\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: x²\n\nSecond term: -2x*sqrt(3)(x² - 4) = -2 sqrt(3) x(x² - 4)\n\nThird term: [sqrt(3)(x² - 4)]² = 3(x² - 4)^2\n\nTherefore, A² = [x² - 2 sqrt(3) x(x² - 4) + 3(x² - 4)^2] / 4\n\nThus, RHS = [x² - 2 sqrt(3) x(x² - 4) + 3(x² - 4)^2]/4 - 4\n\nSo, putting it all together, equation becomes:\n\n(sqrt(3)x + x² - 4)/2 = [x² - 2 sqrt(3) x(x² - 4) + 3(x² - 4)^2]/4 - 4\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominators:\n\n2(sqrt(3)x + x² - 4) = x² - 2 sqrt(3) x(x² - 4) + 3(x² - 4)^2 - 16\n\nLet me expand the left-hand side (LHS):\n\n2 sqrt(3) x + 2x² - 8\n\nRight-hand side (RHS):\n\nx² - 2 sqrt(3) x(x² - 4) + 3(x² - 4)^2 - 16\n\nLet me expand each term on RHS:\n\nFirst term: x²\n\nSecond term: -2 sqrt(3) x(x² - 4) = -2 sqrt(3) x³ + 8 sqrt(3) x\n\nThird term: 3(x² - 4)^2 = 3(x^4 - 8x² + 16) = 3x^4 - 24x² + 48\n\nFourth term: -16\n\nSo, combining all terms on RHS:\n\nx² - 2 sqrt(3) x³ + 8 sqrt(3) x + 3x^4 - 24x² + 48 -16\n\nSimplify:\n\n3x^4 - 2 sqrt(3) x³ + (x² -24x²) + (8 sqrt(3) x) + (48 -16)\n\nWhich is:\n\n3x^4 - 2 sqrt(3) x³ -23x² + 8 sqrt(3) x +32\n\nTherefore, equation:\n\n2 sqrt(3) x + 2x² -8 = 3x^4 - 2 sqrt(3) x³ -23x² + 8 sqrt(3) x +32\n\nBring all terms to the right-hand side:\n\n0 = 3x^4 - 2 sqrt(3) x³ -23x² + 8 sqrt(3) x +32 -2 sqrt(3) x -2x² +8\n\nSimplify:\n\n3x^4 -2 sqrt(3) x³ -25x² +6 sqrt(3) x +40 =0\n\nSo, we have a quartic equation:\n\n3x^4 -2 sqrt(3) x³ -25x² +6 sqrt(3) x +40 =0",

Rotating (0, -4) by 60 degrees would give a point (0*cos60 - (-4)sin60, 0*sin60 + (-4)cos60) = (4 sin60, -4 cos60) = (4*(sqrt(3)/2), -4*(0.5)) = (2 sqrt(3), -2). So that point is (2 sqrt(3), -2).

Let's compute x for z=(3 -sqrt(57))/2.\n\nz=(3 -sqrt(57))/2≈(3 -7.55)/2≈(-4.55)/2≈-2.275. Then x≈-2.275/sqrt(3)≈-1.314. Negative x, fourth quadrant requires positive x. The other solution z=(3 +sqrt(57))/2≈(3 +7.55)/2≈10.55/2≈5.275. Then x≈5.275/sqrt(3)≈3.045. Which is greater than 2, so y would be positive, not in fourth quadrant.\n\nTherefore, only valid x is from first quadratic factor: z=(-1 +sqrt(41))/2, leading to x=(sqrt(41)-1)/(2 sqrt(3)), and y=-(3 +sqrt(41))/6.\n\nBut the problem states the y-coordinate is (a -sqrt(b))/c. Our result is (-3 -sqrt(41))/6. To match the form (a -sqrt(b))/c, we can write it as (-3 -sqrt(41))/6 = (-3 -sqrt(41))/6 = -(3 +sqrt(41))/6. But the problem specifies \"a\" and \"c\" are positive integers. So unless there's a different solution where the y-coordinate is expressed as positive numerator minus sqrt, but ours is negative both terms.",

But we found that (X, Y) is in fourth quadrant, so X>0, Y<0. But according to calculation, X≈-0.577, which would be in second quadrant. Contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the solution. Where is the error?\n\nWait, maybe the parametrization is swapped. Let me clarify:\n\nWhen we rotate a point (x, y) on the original parabola 60° CCW, we get a new point (X, Y). This new point (X, Y) lies on the rotated parabola. However, we are looking for points that lie on both the original parabola and the rotated parabola. Therefore, such a point (X, Y) must satisfy both Y =X² -4 (original parabola) and also be the image of some (x, y) on the original parabola after rotation. So, (X, Y) = rotation of (x, y), and (X, Y) is on original parabola.\n\nBut in our calculation, we found x such that rotating (x, y) gives (X, Y) on original parabola. But when we computed X for x≈1.559, we get X≈-0.577, which is negative, hence not in fourth quadrant. This suggests a miscalculation.\n\nWait, this is critical. If rotating a point (x, y) in the original parabola with x≈1.559 gives (X, Y) with X≈-0.577, which is not in fourth quadrant, then our previous conclusion is wrong.\n\nBut the problem states there's a unique intersection point in the fourth quadrant. Therefore, there must be an error in the process.\n\nWait, perhaps the intersection point is not obtained by rotating a point from the original parabola, but rather the point (X, Y) is on both parabolas without being the image of another point. Wait, but the rotated parabola is the image of the original, so any point on both must be the image of some original point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the error is in assuming the fourth quadrant refers to the original coordinate system. After rotation, the fourth quadrant is still defined by the original axes. So, even though the point is rotated, the fourth quadrant is still where x>0 and y<0 in the original coordinate system.\n\nTherefore, even if the point (X, Y) is obtained by rotating a point (x, y), (X, Y) must have X>0 and Y<0 in the original coordinate system.\n\nBut according to our calculation, rotating (x≈1.559, y≈-1.57) gives (X≈-0.577, Y≈-1.57). But Y≈-1.57 is still negative, but X≈-0.577 is negative, so this would be in the third quadrant. Contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that our solution is in the third quadrant, not fourth. Therefore, there must be an error in the process.\n\nWait, this is a critical point. Our solution gives x≈1.559, y≈-1.57 in the original parabola, which is in fourth quadrant. Rotating this point 60° CCW gives (X, Y). Let's compute that:\n\nX =x cos60 - y sin60 ≈1.559*0.5 - (-1.57)*(sqrt(3)/2)≈0.7795 +1.57*0.866≈0.7795 +1.359≈2.138\n\nY =x sin60 + y cos60≈1.559*0.866 + (-1.57)*0.5≈1.349 -0.785≈0.564\n\nSo, rotated point (X, Y)≈(2.138, 0.564), which is in the first quadrant, but this point must lie on the original parabola Y=X² -4≈(2.138)^2 -4≈4.57 -4≈0.57. So yes, Y≈0.57, which matches.\n\nBut the intersection point is supposed to be on both parabolas. So, the point (X, Y)≈(2.138, 0.57) is on the original parabola and also on the rotated parabola. But rotated parabola is the image of the original parabola after rotation. Therefore, the point (X, Y)≈(2.138, 0.57) is on both parabolas. But this point is in the first quadrant, not fourth. The problem states the unique point in the fourth quadrant. Therefore, our previous approach is flawed.\n\nThis suggests that there's another intersection point in the fourth quadrant that we missed.",

So, a point (X, Y) in the fourth quadrant on the original parabola Y =X² -4, which is also on the rotated parabola. To find such a point, we need to solve for (X, Y) in the fourth quadrant such that Y =X² -4 and Y = [some expression from rotation].\n\nBut how to express the rotated parabola's equation?\n\nAlternatively, parametrize the rotated parabola. The original parabola y =x² -4 can be parametrized as (t, t² -4). After rotating each point 60° CCW, the image is:\n\nX = t cos60 - (t² -4) sin60\n\nY = t sin60 + (t² -4) cos60\n\nSo, the rotated parabola can be parametrized by t as:\n\nX(t) =0.5 t - (sqrt(3)/2)(t² -4)\n\nY(t) = (sqrt(3)/2)t +0.5(t² -4)\n\nNow, to find an intersection point in the fourth quadrant, we need X(t) >0 and Y(t) <0, and Y(t) =X(t)^2 -4.\n\nSo, set Y(t) =X(t)^2 -4:\n\n(sqrt(3)/2)t +0.5(t² -4) = [0.5 t - (sqrt(3)/2)(t² -4)]² -4\n\nThis is the same equation as before.

But wait, according to parametrization:\n\nWait, if t≈1.559, then X(t) =0.5*1.559 - (sqrt(3)/2)( (1.559)^2 -4 )\n\nCompute (1.559)^2≈2.43, so (2.43 -4)= -1.57\n\nThus, X(t)=0.7795 - (sqrt(3)/2)(-1.57)≈0.7795 + (1.732/2)(1.57)≈0.7795 +1.359≈2.138\n\nY(t)= (sqrt(3)/2)*1.559 +0.5*(-1.57)≈1.349 -0.785≈0.564\n\nSo, indeed, (X(t), Y(t))≈(2.138, 0.564) is in first quadrant.\n\nBut if we take another value of t such that X(t) >0 and Y(t) <0.\n\nSuppose t is negative. Let's take t negative.\n\nLet t=-s, s>0.\n\nX(-s)=0.5*(-s) - (sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4)\n\nY(-s)= (sqrt(3)/2)*(-s) +0.5(s² -4)\n\nSo, X(-s)= -0.5s - (sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4)\n\nY(-s)= - (sqrt(3)/2)s +0.5s² -2\n\nWe need X(-s) >0 and Y(-s) <0.\n\nSolve X(-s) >0:\n\n-0.5s - (sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4) >0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (reverse inequality):\n\n0.5s + (sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4) <0\n\nWhich is:\n\nsqrt(3)/2 s² +0.5s -2 sqrt(3) <0\n\nMultiply by 2:\n\nsqrt(3) s² +s -4 sqrt(3) <0\n\nThis is a quadratic in s:\n\nsqrt(3) s² +s -4 sqrt(3) <0\n\nFind s where this holds.\n\nDiscriminant:1 +4*sqrt(3)*4 sqrt(3)=1 +48=49\n\nRoots:\n\ns=(-1 ±7)/(2 sqrt(3))\n\nPositive root:\n\ns=(6)/(2 sqrt(3))=3/sqrt(3)=sqrt(3)≈1.732\n\nNegative root: s=(-8)/(2 sqrt(3)) negative, discard.\n\nThus, inequality holds for s between (-infty, sqrt(3)), but since s>0, the inequality sqrt(3) s² +s -4 sqrt(3) <0 holds for 0 <s <sqrt(3).\n\nSimilarly, Y(-s) <0:\n\n- (sqrt(3)/2)s +0.5s² -2 <0\n\nMultiply by 2:\n\n- sqrt(3)s +s² -4 <0\n\ns² - sqrt(3)s -4 <0\n\nFind roots:\n\ns=(sqrt(3) ±sqrt(3 +16))/2=(sqrt(3) ±sqrt(19))/2\n\nPositive root: (sqrt(3) +sqrt(19))/2≈(1.732 +4.359)/2≈3.045\n\nThus, inequality holds for s between ((sqrt(3) -sqrt(19))/2, (sqrt(3) +sqrt(19))/2). Since s>0, valid interval is 0 <s <(sqrt(3) +sqrt(19))/2≈3.045\n\nTherefore, for s in (0, sqrt(3))≈(0,1.732), both conditions X(-s) >0 and Y(-s) <0 are satisfied. Thus, there exists t negative such that X(t) >0 and Y(t) <0.\n\nTherefore, the intersection point in the fourth quadrant corresponds to a negative t.\n\nLet's solve for t negative.\n\nLet t=-s, s>0.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n(sqrt(3)/2)(-s) +0.5(s² -4) = [0.5*(-s) - (sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4)]² -4\n\nMultiply through:\n\n- (sqrt(3)/2)s +0.5s² -2 = [ -0.5s - (sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4) ]² -4\n\nLet me denote A = -0.5s - (sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4)\n\nThen, equation becomes:\n\n- (sqrt(3)/2)s +0.5s² -2 =A² -4\n\nThus,\n\nA² = - (sqrt(3)/2)s +0.5s² -2 +4=0.5s² - (sqrt(3)/2)s +2\n\nBut A= -0.5s - (sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4)\n\nThus,\n\nA²= [ -0.5s - (sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4) ]²=0.25s² + (3/4)(s² -4)^2 +0.5s*(sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4)*2\n\nWait, expanding:\n\nA²= (-0.5s)^2 + [ - (sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4) ]² +2*(-0.5s)*(-sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4)\n\n=0.25s² + (3/4)(s² -4)^2 + (0.5s)(sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4)",

    "\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the intersection point in the fourth quadrant between the original parabola y = x² - 4 and its image after rotating 60 degrees counterclockwise around the origin. Then, determine the y-coordinate of that point, which is given in the form (a - sqrt(b))/c, and find a + b + c where a, c are coprime. Alright, let's start breaking this down.\n\nFirst, the original parabola is y = x² - 4. That's a standard parabola shifted down by 4 units. Its vertex is at (0, -4), opening upwards. The image after rotating 60 degrees counterclockwise. So, I need to find the equation of the rotated parabola. Then, find where they intersect in the fourth quadrant.\n\nRotation of a curve involves rotating each point on the curve by the given angle. So, to find the equation of the rotated parabola, I can use rotation transformation formulas. Let me recall that when a point (x, y) is rotated counterclockwise by θ degrees around the origin, the new coordinates (x', y') are given by:\n\nx' = x cosθ - y sinθ\n\ny' = x sinθ + y cosθ\n\nSince we're rotating the original parabola, every point (x, y) on y = x² - 4 will be transformed to (x', y') using these equations. So, the image of the parabola after rotation should satisfy these equations with θ = 60 degrees.\n\nBut to find the equation of the rotated parabola, I need to express the original coordinates (x, y) in terms of the new coordinates (x', y'). Let me invert the rotation equations. Let's solve for x and y in terms of x' and y'.\n\nGiven:\n\nx' = x cosθ - y sinθ\n\ny' = x sinθ + y cosθ\n\nLet me write θ = 60°, so cosθ = 0.5, sinθ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.\n\nSo,\n\nx' = 0.5x - (sqrt(3)/2)y\n\ny' = (sqrt(3)/2)x + 0.5y\n\nWe can solve this system for x and y. Let's write it as:\n\n0.5x - (sqrt(3)/2)y = x'\n\n(sqrt(3)/2)x + 0.5y = y'\n\nLet me solve these equations using substitution or elimination. Let's multiply the first equation by 2 to eliminate denominators:\n\nx - sqrt(3)y = 2x'\n\nsqrt(3)x + y = 2y'\n\nNow, let's write equations:\n\n1) x - sqrt(3)y = 2x'\n\n2) sqrt(3)x + y = 2y'\n\nLet me solve equation 1 for x:\n\nx = 2x' + sqrt(3)y\n\nSubstitute this into equation 2:\n\nsqrt(3)(2x' + sqrt(3)y) + y = 2y'\n\nMultiply out:\n\n2 sqrt(3)x' + 3y + y = 2y'\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2 sqrt(3)x' + 4y = 2y'\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nsqrt(3)x' + 2y = y'",
    "But wait, this seems messy. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, express x and y in terms of x' and y' using inverse rotation. Since rotation is a linear transformation, the inverse rotation is by -θ. So, θ = -60°, which would give:\n\nx = x' cosθ + y' sinθ\n\ny = -x' sinθ + y' cosθ\n\nWait, maybe that's easier. Let me check. Because rotating a point by θ gives (x', y'), so to get back (x, y), we rotate by -θ. So, yes, the inverse rotation matrix is [cosθ, sinθ; -sinθ, cosθ] for θ = 60°, but since we are rotating back by -60°, θ becomes -60°, so cos(-θ) = cosθ, sin(-θ) = -sinθ.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the direction. Let me verify. The original coordinates (x, y) rotated by 60° CCW gives (x', y'). So, to get (x, y) in terms of (x', y'), we need to rotate (x', y') by -60°, i.e., 60° clockwise.\n\nSo, the inverse transformation is:\n\nx = x' cos60° + y' sin60°\n\ny = -x' sin60° + y' cos60°\n\nYes, because rotating back by -60°.\n\nSo, substituting cos60° = 0.5, sin60° = sqrt(3)/2:\n\nx = 0.5 x' + (sqrt(3)/2) y'\n\ny = - (sqrt(3)/2) x' + 0.5 y'\n\nTherefore, the original parabola equation y = x² - 4 can be written in terms of the rotated coordinates (x', y') as:\n\ny = x² - 4\n\nBut substituting x and y from above:\n\n- (sqrt(3)/2) x' + 0.5 y' = [0.5 x' + (sqrt(3)/2) y']² - 4",
    "So, that's the equation of the rotated parabola in terms of x' and y'. Therefore, to find intersections between original parabola and rotated parabola, we can set (x', y') equal to (x, y), because the intersection points are points that lie on both the original and rotated parabola. Wait, but actually, the rotated parabola is the image of the original parabola after rotation. So, a point (x, y) is on the original parabola if y = x² - 4. The same point, after rotation, would be (x', y'), which lies on the rotated parabola. However, the intersection points between original and rotated parabola are points that are on both parabolas. So, a point (X, Y) that is on the original parabola Y = X² - 4 and also on the rotated parabola. So, substituting (X, Y) into the rotated parabola's equation.\n\nBut since the rotated parabola is the image of the original parabola under rotation, the rotated parabola's equation can be written as the original equation transformed by rotation. Therefore, substituting the inverse rotation expressions into the original equation.\n\nWait, maybe another approach is better. Let me consider that a point (X, Y) lies on both the original parabola and its rotated image. Therefore, (X, Y) must satisfy Y = X² - 4, and also (X, Y) must be the image of some point (x, y) on the original parabola after rotation. But since (X, Y) is the image of (x, y) under rotation, then:\n\nX = x cos60° - y sin60°\n\nY = x sin60° + y cos60°\n\nBut since (x, y) is on the original parabola, y = x² - 4. Therefore, substituting y into the rotation equations:\n\nX = x * 0.5 - (x² - 4) * (sqrt(3)/2)\n\nY = x * (sqrt(3)/2) + (x² - 4) * 0.5\n\nBut since (X, Y) must also lie on the original parabola Y = X² - 4. Therefore, substituting X and Y from above into Y = X² - 4.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nx*(sqrt(3)/2) + (x² - 4)*0.5 = [0.5x - (sqrt(3)/2)(x² - 4)]² - 4\n\nThis equation relates x, which is the x-coordinate of the original parabola point that maps to the intersection point (X, Y). Solving this equation for x will give us the x-coordinate(s) of the original parabola that, when rotated, result in points (X, Y) that are also on the original parabola.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe manageable. Let's write it step by step.\n\nLeft-hand side (LHS) of the equation:\n\nY = (sqrt(3)/2)x + (0.5)(x² - 4)\n\nRight-hand side (RHS):\n\nX² - 4 = [0.5x - (sqrt(3)/2)(x² - 4)]² - 4\n\nTherefore, equate LHS and RHS:\n\n(sqrt(3)/2)x + (0.5)(x² - 4) = [0.5x - (sqrt(3)/2)(x² - 4)]² - 4\n\nLet me simplify both sides first.\n\nStarting with LHS:\n\nMultiply sqrt(3)/2 x + (x² - 4)/2\n\nSo, LHS = (sqrt(3)x + x² - 4)/2\n\nRHS: Let's compute the square term first.\n\nLet me denote A = 0.5x - (sqrt(3)/2)(x² - 4)\n\nThen, RHS = A² - 4\n\nCompute A:\n\nA = (1/2)x - (sqrt(3)/2)(x² - 4)\n\nSo, A = [x - sqrt(3)(x² - 4)] / 2\n\nTherefore, A² = [x - sqrt(3)(x² - 4)]² / 4\n\nExpanding the numerator:\n\n[x - sqrt(3)(x² - 4)]² = x² - 2x*sqrt(3)(x² - 4) + [sqrt(3)(x² - 4)]²\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: x²\n\nSecond term: -2x*sqrt(3)(x² - 4) = -2 sqrt(3) x(x² - 4)\n\nThird term: [sqrt(3)(x² - 4)]² = 3(x² - 4)^2\n\nTherefore, A² = [x² - 2 sqrt(3) x(x² - 4) + 3(x² - 4)^2] / 4\n\nThus, RHS = [x² - 2 sqrt(3) x(x² - 4) + 3(x² - 4)^2]/4 - 4\n\nSo, putting it all together, equation becomes:\n\n(sqrt(3)x + x² - 4)/2 = [x² - 2 sqrt(3) x(x² - 4) + 3(x² - 4)^2]/4 - 4\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominators:\n\n2(sqrt(3)x + x² - 4) = x² - 2 sqrt(3) x(x² - 4) + 3(x² - 4)^2 - 16\n\nLet me expand the left-hand side (LHS):\n\n2 sqrt(3) x + 2x² - 8\n\nRight-hand side (RHS):\n\nx² - 2 sqrt(3) x(x² - 4) + 3(x² - 4)^2 - 16\n\nLet me expand each term on RHS:\n\nFirst term: x²\n\nSecond term: -2 sqrt(3) x(x² - 4) = -2 sqrt(3) x³ + 8 sqrt(3) x\n\nThird term: 3(x² - 4)^2 = 3(x^4 - 8x² + 16) = 3x^4 - 24x² + 48\n\nFourth term: -16\n\nSo, combining all terms on RHS:\n\nx² - 2 sqrt(3) x³ + 8 sqrt(3) x + 3x^4 - 24x² + 48 -16\n\nSimplify:\n\n3x^4 - 2 sqrt(3) x³ + (x² -24x²) + (8 sqrt(3) x) + (48 -16)\n\nWhich is:\n\n3x^4 - 2 sqrt(3) x³ -23x² + 8 sqrt(3) x +32\n\nTherefore, equation:\n\n2 sqrt(3) x + 2x² -8 = 3x^4 - 2 sqrt(3) x³ -23x² + 8 sqrt(3) x +32\n\nBring all terms to the right-hand side:\n\n0 = 3x^4 - 2 sqrt(3) x³ -23x² + 8 sqrt(3) x +32 -2 sqrt(3) x -2x² +8\n\nSimplify:\n\n3x^4 -2 sqrt(3) x³ -25x² +6 sqrt(3) x +40 =0\n\nSo, we have a quartic equation:\n\n3x^4 -2 sqrt(3) x³ -25x² +6 sqrt(3) x +40 =0",
    "Hmm, quartic equation. This seems quite complicated. Maybe there's a substitution or factoring possible. Let's check for possible rational roots. But coefficients involve sqrt(3), so rational roots might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps factor by grouping.",
    "Alternatively, maybe substituting t = x sqrt(3) or something. Wait, perhaps let me check if the equation can be factored.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps notice that the original parabola and its rotated image intersect at points that are fixed under rotation? But a 60 degree rotation is not 180 degrees, so fixed points would only be the origin, but the origin is (0, -4) rotated? Wait, original parabola at origin? Wait, the original parabola y =x² -4 passes through (0, -4). Rotating (0, -4) by 60 degrees would give a point (0*cos60 - (-4)sin60, 0*sin60 + (-4)cos60) = (4 sin60, -4 cos60) = (4*(sqrt(3)/2), -4*(0.5)) = (2 sqrt(3), -2). So that point is (2 sqrt(3), -2). Is that on the original parabola? Let's check: y = (2 sqrt(3))² -4 = 12 -4 =8. But the y-coordinate is -2, so no. So that rotated point isn't on the original parabola.",
    "Alternatively, maybe symmetry. But since the rotation is 60 degrees, which is not a multiple of 180, so the parabolas are not symmetric in a way that would make intersections obvious.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps parametrize the original parabola and find its image after rotation, then set equations equal.\n\nWait, maybe parametrize x as t, then y = t² -4. Then, the image after rotation is:\n\nX = t cos60 - (t² -4) sin60\n\nY = t sin60 + (t² -4) cos60\n\nSo, X = 0.5 t - (sqrt(3)/2)(t² -4)\n\nY = (sqrt(3)/2) t + 0.5(t² -4)\n\nSo, the image parabola can be parametrized as (X(t), Y(t)) where t is real.\n\nNow, the intersection points between original parabola and image parabola are points (X, Y) such that Y = X² -4 and also (X, Y) = (X(t), Y(t)) for some t. Therefore, substituting Y(t) = X(t)² -4.\n\nSo, Y(t) = X(t)^2 -4\n\nTherefore:\n\n(sqrt(3)/2) t + 0.5(t² -4) = [0.5 t - (sqrt(3)/2)(t² -4)]² -4\n\nThis is exactly the same equation as before. So, we end up with the same quartic equation. So, perhaps proceed to solve this quartic equation.",
    "Alternatively, maybe assume that the intersection point in the fourth quadrant has negative y-coordinate and positive x-coordinate? Wait, fourth quadrant is positive x and negative y. Original parabola y = x² -4. So, when x is positive, y is positive if x² >4, else negative. So, for x between -2 and 2, y is negative. So, in the fourth quadrant, x positive and y negative, so x between 0 and 2? Wait, no. Wait, x can be any positive, but y negative. So, x² -4 <0 => x² <4 => |x| <2. So, in the fourth quadrant, x is between 0 and 2, y negative.\n\nBut after rotation, the image parabola might have points in the fourth quadrant as well. So, the intersection point is in the fourth quadrant, so x positive, y negative.\n\nGiven that, perhaps we can parametrize x as a variable between 0 and 2, and try to solve the quartic equation.\n\nBut quartic equation is messy. Let me see if I can factor it.\n\nEquation: 3x^4 -2 sqrt(3) x³ -25x² +6 sqrt(3) x +40 =0",
    "Hmm. Maybe factor as quadratic in x²? Let me check:",
    "But coefficients involve sqrt(3) terms. Alternatively, perhaps factor into two quadratics.\n\nSuppose the quartic factors as (ax² + bx + c)(dx² + ex + f).

Hmm.\n\nBut let's compute numerical values to identify which solution is in the fourth quadrant.\n\nFourth quadrant: x >0, y <0.\n\nOriginal parabola y =x² -4. So y <0 implies x² <4 => |x| <2. So x must be between 0 and 2.\n\nCompute each x:\n\nFirst solution: [ -sqrt(3) + sqrt(123) ] /6\n\nsqrt(3)≈1.732, sqrt(123)≈11.09\n\nSo numerator≈-1.732 +11.09≈9.358, divided by6≈1.559. So x≈1.559, which is between 0 and2.\n\nSecond solution: [ -sqrt(3) - sqrt(123) ] /6≈(-1.732 -11.09)/6≈-12.822/6≈-2.137. Negative x, so discard.\n\nThird solution: [3 sqrt(3) + sqrt(171) ] /6≈3*1.732 +13.076≈5.196 +13.076≈18.272/6≈3.045.

So that's the x-coordinate in fourth quadrant.\n\nNow, compute y-coordinate: y=x² -4≈(1.559)^2 -4≈2.43 -4≈-1.57. So y≈-1.57.\n\nBut need exact value. Let's find exact expression.\n\nFrom the quartic solution, we had z² +z -10=0 gives z=[-1 ±sqrt(41)]/2. We took the positive root z=[-1 +sqrt(41)]/2.\n\nThen, x= z / sqrt(3)= [ -1 +sqrt(41) ]/(2 sqrt(3))= [sqrt(41)-1]/(2 sqrt(3)).\n\nRationalize denominator:\n\nx= [sqrt(41)-1]/(2 sqrt(3)) * sqrt(3)/sqrt(3)= [sqrt(123) - sqrt(3)]/(6)\n\nSo, x= (sqrt(123) - sqrt(3))/6\n\nThen, y= x² -4.\n\nCompute x²:\n\n[(sqrt(123) - sqrt(3))/6]^2= [123 +3 -2 sqrt(123*3)]/36= [126 -2 sqrt(369)]/36= [126 -2*19.209]/36≈[126 -38.418]/36≈87.582/36≈2.433, which matches the approximate value.\n\nBut exact value:\n\nx²= (126 -2 sqrt(369))/36= (63 - sqrt(369))/18= (63 - sqrt(9*41))/18= (63 -3 sqrt(41))/18= (21 - sqrt(41))/6\n\nTherefore, y= x² -4= (21 - sqrt(41))/6 -4= (21 - sqrt(41) -24)/6= (-3 - sqrt(41))/6= -(3 + sqrt(41))/6",

But our result is negative numerator: (-3 -sqrt(41))/6. However, the problem's form is (a -sqrt(b))/c, where a, b, c are positive integers.

Our result is (-3 -sqrt(41))/6. To write this as (a -sqrt(b))/c, factor out the negative sign:\n\n-(3 +sqrt(41))/6 = (-3 -sqrt(41))/6 = ( -3 -sqrt(41) ) /6. But since a, b, c are positive integers, perhaps there's a miscalculation.\n\nWait, maybe the quartic equation had another solution. Wait, we had four roots for z, but only one x in the fourth quadrant. But maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, let's check the other quadratic factor z² -3z -12=0, which gave solutions z=(3 ±sqrt(57))/2. Then x= z/sqrt(3). Let's compute x for z=(3 -sqrt(57))/2.\n\nz=(3 -sqrt(57))/2≈(3 -7.55)/2≈(-4.55)/2≈-2.275. Then x≈-2.275/sqrt(3)≈-1.314. Negative x, fourth quadrant requires positive x. The other solution z=(3 +sqrt(57))/2≈(3 +7.55)/2≈10.55/2≈5.275. Then x≈5.275/sqrt(3)≈3.045. Which is greater than 2, so y would be positive, not in fourth quadrant.\n\nTherefore, only valid x is from first quadratic factor: z=(-1 +sqrt(41))/2, leading to x=(sqrt(41)-1)/(2 sqrt(3)), and y=-(3 +sqrt(41))/6.\n\nBut the problem states the y-coordinate is (a -sqrt(b))/c. Our result is (-3 -sqrt(41))/6. To match the form (a -sqrt(b))/c, we can write it as (-3 -sqrt(41))/6 = (-3 -sqrt(41))/6 = -(3 +sqrt(41))/6.

Then, solving gives x=(sqrt(41)-1)/(2 sqrt(3)), and y=-(3 +sqrt(41))/6.\n\nBut according to problem statement, the y-coordinate is (a -sqrt(b))/c. So unless there's a different solution, perhaps I missed a root.\n\nWait, let's check the other quadratic factor solutions. We had z² -3z -12=0, solutions z=(3 ±sqrt(57))/2. Then x=(3 ±sqrt(57))/(2 sqrt(3)). Let's compute for z=(3 -sqrt(57))/2≈(3 -7.55)/2≈-2.275, so x≈-2.275/1.732≈-1.314. Negative x, so not in fourth quadrant. The other solution z=(3 +sqrt(57))/2≈5.275, x≈5.275/1.732≈3.05. Then y=x² -4≈9.3 -4≈5.3.

However, we are looking for points that lie on both the original parabola and the rotated parabola. Therefore, such a point (X, Y) must satisfy both Y =X² -4 (original parabola) and also be the image of some (x, y) on the original parabola after rotation. So, (X, Y) = rotation of (x, y), and (X, Y) is on original parabola.\n\nBut in our calculation, we found x such that rotating (x, y) gives (X, Y) on original parabola. But when we computed X for x≈1.559, we get X≈-0.577, which is negative, hence not in fourth quadrant. This suggests a miscalculation.\n\nWait, this is critical. If rotating a point (x, y) in the original parabola with x≈1.559 gives (X, Y) with X≈-0.577, which is not in fourth quadrant, then our previous conclusion is wrong.\n\nBut the problem states there's a unique intersection point in the fourth quadrant. Therefore, there must be an error in the process.\n\nWait, perhaps the intersection point is not obtained by rotating a point from the original parabola, but rather the point (X, Y) is on both parabolas without being the image of another point. Wait, but the rotated parabola is the image of the original, so any point on both must be the image of some original point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the error is in assuming the fourth quadrant refers to the original coordinate system. After rotation, the fourth quadrant is still defined by the original axes. So, even though the point is rotated, the fourth quadrant is still where x>0 and y<0 in the original coordinate system.\n\nTherefore, even if the point (X, Y) is obtained by rotating a point (x, y), (X, Y) must have X>0 and Y<0 in the original coordinate system.\n\nBut according to our calculation, rotating (x≈1.559, y≈-1.57) gives (X≈-0.577, Y≈-1.57). But Y≈-1.57 is still negative, but X≈-0.577 is negative, so this would be in the third quadrant. Contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that our solution is in the third quadrant, not fourth. Therefore, there must be an error in the process.\n\nWait, this is a critical point. Our solution gives x≈1.559, y≈-1.57 in the original parabola, which is in fourth quadrant. Rotating this point 60° CCW gives (X, Y). Let's compute that:\n\nX =x cos60 - y sin60 ≈1.559*0.5 - (-1.57)*(sqrt(3)/2)≈0.7795 +1.57*0.866≈0.7795 +1.359≈2.138\n\nY =x sin60 + y cos60≈1.559*0.866 + (-1.57)*0.5≈1.349 -0.785≈0.564\n\nSo, rotated point (X, Y)≈(2.138, 0.564), which is in the first quadrant, but this point must lie on the original parabola Y=X² -4≈(2.138)^2 -4≈4.57 -4≈0.57. So yes, Y≈0.57, which matches.\n\nBut the intersection point is supposed to be on both parabolas. So, the point (X, Y)≈(2.138, 0.57) is on the original parabola and also on the rotated parabola. But rotated parabola is the image of the original parabola after rotation. Therefore, the point (X, Y)≈(2.138, 0.57) is on both parabolas. But this point is in the first quadrant, not fourth. The problem states the unique point in the fourth quadrant. Therefore, our previous approach is flawed.\n\nThis suggests that there's another intersection point in the fourth quadrant that we missed.",
    "Wait, but according to the quartic equation solution, the only positive x less than 2 leads to a rotated point in the first quadrant. Therefore, where is the fourth quadrant intersection?",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the intersection point is such that both (x, y) and its rotated image (X, Y) are in the fourth quadrant. But rotating a point in the fourth quadrant 60° CCW would likely move it to another quadrant.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the intersection point is a fixed point under rotation, but 60° rotation has only the origin as fixed point, which isn't on the parabola.",
    "Wait, this is confusing. Let's visualize.\n\nOriginal parabola y =x² -4, vertex at (0, -4), opening upwards. Rotated 60° CCW, the image parabola will have a different orientation. The intersection in the fourth quadrant would be a point that is on both the original and rotated parabola.\n\nBut according to our previous calculation, rotating a point in the original parabola's fourth quadrant leads to a point in the first quadrant. So, how can there be an intersection in the fourth quadrant?",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the rotated parabola extends into the fourth quadrant and intersects the original parabola there. So, a point (X, Y) in the fourth quadrant on the original parabola Y =X² -4, which is also on the rotated parabola. To find such a point, we need to solve for (X, Y) in the fourth quadrant such that Y =X² -4 and Y = [some expression from rotation].\n\nBut how to express the rotated parabola's equation?\n\nAlternatively, parametrize the rotated parabola. The original parabola y =x² -4 can be parametrized as (t, t² -4). After rotating each point 60° CCW, the image is:\n\nX = t cos60 - (t² -4) sin60\n\nY = t sin60 + (t² -4) cos60\n\nSo, the rotated parabola can be parametrized by t as:\n\nX(t) =0.5 t - (sqrt(3)/2)(t² -4)\n\nY(t) = (sqrt(3)/2)t +0.5(t² -4)\n\nNow, to find an intersection point in the fourth quadrant, we need X(t) >0 and Y(t) <0, and Y(t) =X(t)^2 -4.\n\nSo, set Y(t) =X(t)^2 -4:\n\n(sqrt(3)/2)t +0.5(t² -4) = [0.5 t - (sqrt(3)/2)(t² -4)]² -4\n\nThis is the same equation as before. So, solving this gives t such that X(t) >0 and Y(t) <0.",
    "Previously, we found t≈1.559 leads to X(t)≈-0.577, Y(t)≈0.564, which is not in fourth quadrant. But wait, according to parametrization:\n\nWait, if t≈1.559, then X(t) =0.5*1.559 - (sqrt(3)/2)( (1.559)^2 -4 )\n\nCompute (1.559)^2≈2.43, so (2.43 -4)= -1.57\n\nThus, X(t)=0.7795 - (sqrt(3)/2)(-1.57)≈0.7795 + (1.732/2)(1.57)≈0.7795 +1.359≈2.138\n\nY(t)= (sqrt(3)/2)*1.559 +0.5*(-1.57)≈1.349 -0.785≈0.564\n\nSo, indeed, (X(t), Y(t))≈(2.138, 0.564) is in first quadrant.\n\nBut if we take another value of t such that X(t) >0 and Y(t) <0.\n\nSuppose t is negative. Let's take t negative.\n\nLet t=-s, s>0.\n\nX(-s)=0.5*(-s) - (sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4)\n\nY(-s)= (sqrt(3)/2)*(-s) +0.5(s² -4)\n\nSo, X(-s)= -0.5s - (sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4)\n\nY(-s)= - (sqrt(3)/2)s +0.5s² -2\n\nWe need X(-s) >0 and Y(-s) <0.\n\nSolve X(-s) >0:\n\n-0.5s - (sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4) >0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (reverse inequality):\n\n0.5s + (sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4) <0\n\nWhich is:\n\nsqrt(3)/2 s² +0.5s -2 sqrt(3) <0\n\nMultiply by 2:\n\nsqrt(3) s² +s -4 sqrt(3) <0\n\nThis is a quadratic in s:\n\nsqrt(3) s² +s -4 sqrt(3) <0\n\nFind s where this holds.\n\nDiscriminant:1 +4*sqrt(3)*4 sqrt(3)=1 +48=49\n\nRoots:\n\ns=(-1 ±7)/(2 sqrt(3))\n\nPositive root:\n\ns=(6)/(2 sqrt(3))=3/sqrt(3)=sqrt(3)≈1.732\n\nNegative root: s=(-8)/(2 sqrt(3)) negative, discard.\n\nThus, inequality holds for s between (-infty, sqrt(3)), but since s>0, the inequality sqrt(3) s² +s -4 sqrt(3) <0 holds for 0 <s <sqrt(3).\n\nSimilarly, Y(-s) <0:\n\n- (sqrt(3)/2)s +0.5s² -2 <0\n\nMultiply by 2:\n\n- sqrt(3)s +s² -4 <0\n\ns² - sqrt(3)s -4 <0\n\nFind roots:\n\ns=(sqrt(3) ±sqrt(3 +16))/2=(sqrt(3) ±sqrt(19))/2\n\nPositive root: (sqrt(3) +sqrt(19))/2≈(1.732 +4.359)/2≈3.045\n\nThus, inequality holds for s between ((sqrt(3) -sqrt(19))/2, (sqrt(3) +sqrt(19))/2). Since s>0, valid interval is 0 <s <(sqrt(3) +sqrt(19))/2≈3.045\n\nTherefore, for s in (0, sqrt(3))≈(0,1.732), both conditions X(-s) >0 and Y(-s) <0 are satisfied. Thus, there exists t negative such that X(t) >0 and Y(t) <0.\n\nTherefore, the intersection point in the fourth quadrant corresponds to a negative t.\n\nLet's solve for t negative.\n\nLet t=-s, s>0.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n(sqrt(3)/2)(-s) +0.5(s² -4) = [0.5*(-s) - (sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4)]² -4\n\nMultiply through:\n\n- (sqrt(3)/2)s +0.5s² -2 = [ -0.5s - (sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4) ]² -4\n\nLet me denote A = -0.5s - (sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4)\n\nThen, equation becomes:\n\n- (sqrt(3)/2)s +0.5s² -2 =A² -4\n\nThus,\n\nA² = - (sqrt(3)/2)s +0.5s² -2 +4=0.5s² - (sqrt(3)/2)s +2\n\nBut A= -0.5s - (sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4)\n\nThus,\n\nA²= [ -0.5s - (sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4) ]²=0.25s² + (3/4)(s² -4)^2 +0.5s*(sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4)*2\n\nWait, expanding:\n\nA²= (-0.5s)^2 + [ - (sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4) ]² +2*(-0.5s)*(-sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4)\n\n=0.25s² + (3/4)(s² -4)^2 + (0.5s)(sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4)",
    "Wait, no:\n\nWait, expanding (a +b)^2 =a² +2ab +b²\n\nWhere a= -0.5s, b= -sqrt(3)/2(s² -4)\n\nThus,\n\nA²=0.25s² +2*(-0.5s)*(-sqrt(3)/2)(s² -4) + (3/4)(s² -4)^2\n\n=0.25s² + (0.5s*sqrt(3))(s² -4) + (3/4)(s² -4)^2\n\nThus,\n\nA²=0.25s² +0.5 sqrt(3) s(s² -4) +0.75(s² -4)^2\n\nSet equal to 0.5s² -0.5 sqrt(3)s +2:\n\n0.25s² +0.5 sqrt(3) s(s² -4) +0.75(s² -4)^2 =0.5s² -0.5 sqrt(3)s +2\n\nMultiply all terms by4 to eliminate denominators:\n\ns² +2 sqrt(3) s(s² -4) +3(s² -4)^2 =2s² -2 sqrt(3)s +8\n\nExpand left-hand side:\n\ns² +2 sqrt(3)s³ -8 sqrt(3)s +3(s^4 -8s² +16)\n\n= s² +2 sqrt(3)s³ -8 sqrt(3)s +3s^4 -24s² +48\n\n=3s^4 +2 sqrt(3)s³ -23s² -8 sqrt(3)s +48\n\nRight-hand side:\n\n2s² -2 sqrt(3)s +8\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n3s^4 +2 sqrt(3)s³ -23s² -8 sqrt(3)s +48 -2s² +2 sqrt(3)s -8=0\n\nSimplify:\n\n3s^4 +2 sqrt(3)s³ -25s² -6 sqrt(3)s +40=0\n\nThis is similar to the previous quartic equation but with some sign changes.

    "Assuming that the quartic equation for s can be solved exactly, but given the complexity, perhaps the problem expects us to consider symmetry or another approach.",
    "Alternatively, consider that the original parabola and the rotated parabola intersect at a point in the fourth quadrant. The coordinates (X, Y) satisfy Y=X² -4 and also the rotation equations:\n\nX =0.5x - (sqrt(3)/2)y\n\nY = (sqrt(3)/2)x +0.5y\n\nBut since (x, y) is on the original parabola, y=x² -4. So substituting y=x² -4 into the rotation equations:\n\nX =0.5x - (sqrt(3)/2)(x² -4)\n\nY = (sqrt(3)/2)x +0.5(x² -4)\n\nBut (X, Y) must also lie on the original parabola: Y =X² -4\n\nThus, equation:\n\n(sqrt(3)/2)x +0.5(x² -4) = [0.5x - (sqrt(3)/2)(x² -4)]² -4\n\nThis is the same equation we had before, leading to quartic. However, the solution we found earlier led to a point in the first quadrant when rotated, but the numerical solution for negative t gives a point in the fourth quadrant.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the correct answer involves the quartic solution we found initially, but there must be an error in the rotation direction or quadrant analysis.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the intersection point's y-coordinate is (-3 -sqrt(41))/6, which can be written as (-3 -sqrt(41))/6 = ( -3 -sqrt(41) ) /6 = ( a -sqrt(b) ) /c with a= -3, but a must be positive. Therefore, this suggests that there's a miscalculation.",
