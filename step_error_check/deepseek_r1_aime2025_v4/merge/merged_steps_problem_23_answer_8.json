    "problem": "From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $ N $ cents, where $ N $ is a positive integer. He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.",

The greedy algorithm here is choosing the highest denomination possible at each step without exceeding N.

      "content": "First, let me understand when the greedy algorithm fails. For 42 cents, greedy gives 25 + 10 + 7*1 = 9 coins, but using 4*10 + 2*1 = 6 coins is better. So, in this case, avoiding the 25-cent coin allows using more 10s, which are higher value than 1s, thus reducing the total number. So, the problem arises when using a higher denomination (25) forces us to use too many lower ones (1s) instead of using more of the middle denomination (10s).\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to find N where using as many 25s as possible, then 10s, then 1s gives the minimal coins. To check if greedy is optimal for a given N, we need to ensure that there's no way to use fewer coins by deviating from the greedy approach. That is, replacing some combination of higher coins with lower ones doesn't result in a lower total number of coins.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let’s denote the number of coins in the greedy approach as G(N). Then, we need to check if any other combination of coins (with different numbers of 25s, 10s, 1s) adds up to N with fewer coins than G(N). If not, then N is counted.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each N from 1 to 1000:\n   a. Compute the greedy coin count G(N).\n   b. Check all possible combinations of coins (25,10,1) that sum to N, find the minimal coin count M(N).\n   c. If G(N) == M(N), increment the count.\n\nBut since checking all possible combinations for each N up to 1000 would be computationally intensive, especially manually, I need a smarter way.",

      "content": "Alternatively, perhaps we can find conditions on N where using fewer quarters and more dimes or pennies would lead to fewer coins.\n\nLet me think of possible deviations from the greedy approach. The greedy approach uses maximum quarters first. A possible better solution might use one fewer quarter, and compensate with more dimes and pennies. Let's see:\n\nSuppose in the greedy solution, we have q quarters, d dimes, p pennies. If we use q-1 quarters instead, then the remaining amount is N -25(q-1) = N -25q +25 = (N -25q) +25. Since N -25q is the amount left after q quarters, which is less than 25. So, remaining amount after q-1 quarters is (N -25q) +25 = (N mod 25) +25. Wait, but N mod 25 is N -25q. So, remaining amount is (N mod 25) +25. Which is between 25 and 50 (since N mod 25 is less than 25). So, after using q-1 quarters, the remaining amount is between 25 and 50 cents.\n\nThen, how would the greedy algorithm handle that remaining amount? For the remaining amount S (25 ≤ S < 50), the greedy approach would use two 10s (20 cents) and then S -20 pennies. So, total coins would be (q-1) + 2 + (S -20). But S = (N mod25) +25. So, S -20 = (N mod25) +5. Therefore, total coins would be (q-1) +2 + (N mod25 +5) = q -1 +2 + N mod25 +5 = q + N mod25 +6.\n\nCompare this to the original greedy coins: q + d + p. Since original remaining amount after q quarters is N mod25. So, d = floor((N mod25)/10), p = N mod25 -10d. So, original coins: q + d + p = q + (d + p). Since p = (N mod25 -10d), so d + p = d + (N mod25 -10d) = N mod25 -9d. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, p = N mod25 -10d. So, d + p = d + (N mod25 -10d) = N mod25 -9d. But N mod25 is between 0 and24. So, d can be 0,1,2 (since 10*2=20 ≤24). So, for N mod25:\n\nIf N mod25 is between 0-9: d=0, p=N mod25. So, d + p = N mod25.\n\nIf N mod25 is between10-19: d=1, p=N mod25 -10. So, d + p =1 + (N mod25 -10) = N mod25 -9.\n\nIf N mod25 is between20-24: d=2, p=N mod25 -20. So, d + p=2 + (N mod25 -20) = N mod25 -18.\n\nTherefore, original coins: q + (d + p) = q + [N mod25 -9d]. But since d is floor((N mod25)/10), so:\n\nOriginal coins: q + (N mod25 -9d).\n\nBut in the alternative approach (using q-1 quarters), coins are q + N mod25 +6 -1? Wait, earlier calculation was:\n\nAlternative coins: (q-1) + 2 + (N mod25 +5) = q -1 +2 + N mod25 +5 = q + N mod25 +6.",

So, for N where r=5-9 or15-19, greedy is not optimal.\n\nTherefore, the values of N where greedy fails are those where N mod25 is in5-9 or15-19.

Since each cycle from25k+1 to25k+25, but since N starts at1, perhaps the first cycle is1-25, second26-50, etc. So, total cycles:40. Each cycle has10 failure points (N where N mod25 is5-9 or15-19).

Wait, earlier analysis assumes that when you use q-1 quarters, you can compensate with dimes and pennies. But for N=5:\n\nq=0 (since5 <25). So, q-1 would be-1, which is invalid. Therefore, the earlier analysis applies only when q≥1.

So, for N=1-24, greedy uses as many dimes as possible (if N≥10) then pennies. Since dimes are the highest denomination after quarters, but for N<25, quarters can't be used, so greedy is using dimes and pennies. But since dimes are 10, and pennies are1, the greedy algorithm here is equivalent to using as many dimes as possible, then pennies.

So, N=976 corresponds to residue1, N=977=2,...,N=1000=25=0.\n\nTherefore, in block976-1000, the bad N's areN=976+4=980 to980+4=984 (residues5-9) andN=976+14=990 to990+4=994 (residues15-19). So, N=980-984 and990-994. Then,N=995-999 correspond to residues20-24, which are not bad. N=1000 is residue0.\n\nTherefore, in each block, including the last block976-1000, there are10 failures:N=980-984,990-994. So, total blocks=40, each contributing10 failures.

    "\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many numbers N between 1 and 1000 inclusive are such that the greedy algorithm for making change (using 1, 10, and 25 cent coins) gives the minimal number of coins. The greedy algorithm here is choosing the highest denomination possible at each step without exceeding N. But sometimes, like in the example given (42 cents), the greedy approach doesn't give the minimal number of coins. So, I need to find all N where the greedy approach actually is the best possible.",
    "First, let me understand when the greedy algorithm fails. For 42 cents, greedy gives 25 + 10 + 7*1 = 9 coins, but using 4*10 + 2*1 = 6 coins is better. So, in this case, avoiding the 25-cent coin allows using more 10s, which are higher value than 1s, thus reducing the total number. So, the problem arises when using a higher denomination (25) forces us to use too many lower ones (1s) instead of using more of the middle denomination (10s).\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to find N where using as many 25s as possible, then 10s, then 1s gives the minimal coins. To check if greedy is optimal for a given N, we need to ensure that there's no way to use fewer coins by deviating from the greedy approach. That is, replacing some combination of higher coins with lower ones doesn't result in a lower total number of coins.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let’s denote the number of coins in the greedy approach as G(N). Then, we need to check if any other combination of coins (with different numbers of 25s, 10s, 1s) adds up to N with fewer coins than G(N). If not, then N is counted.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each N from 1 to 1000:\n   a. Compute the greedy coin count G(N).\n   b. Check all possible combinations of coins (25,10,1) that sum to N, find the minimal coin count M(N).\n   c. If G(N) == M(N), increment the count.\n\nBut since checking all possible combinations for each N up to 1000 would be computationally intensive, especially manually, I need a smarter way.",
    "Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can determine when the greedy algorithm fails, and thus subtract those cases from the total (1000). But how?\n\nIn the coin system of 1, 10, 25, the greedy algorithm is not always optimal. For example, the canonical example is when using 25 forces you into a situation where you have to use many 1s instead of using more 10s.\n\nSo perhaps the failures occur at specific residues modulo 25 or 10? Let's think.",
    "Let me first recall that for the standard coin system (1,5,10,25), the greedy algorithm works. But here, we have 1,10,25. Wait, no 5-cent coin. So, maybe the absence of 5-cent coins causes issues?",
    "Wait, in the problem statement, coins are 1,10,25. So, denominations are 1,10,25. So, the coin system is not the standard US system. Therefore, the greedy algorithm can fail here.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding N where the minimal number of coins is equal to the greedy count.\n\nI need to find all N in 1-1000 where the greedy algorithm is optimal.",
    "First, let's formalize the greedy algorithm:\n\nFor a given N, the greedy approach is:\n\n1. Use as many 25s as possible: q = floor(N / 25)\n2. Then use as many 10s as possible with the remaining amount: d = floor((N - 25q) / 10)\n3. Then use 1s for the remainder: p = N - 25q -10d\n\nTotal coins: q + d + p\n\nTo check if this is optimal, we need to see if there exists a combination with q' quarters, d' dimes, p' pennies such that 25q' +10d' + p' = N and q' + d' + p' < q + d + p.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps we can find conditions on N where using fewer quarters and more dimes or pennies would lead to fewer coins.\n\nLet me think of possible deviations from the greedy approach. The greedy approach uses maximum quarters first. A possible better solution might use one fewer quarter, and compensate with more dimes and pennies. Let's see:\n\nSuppose in the greedy solution, we have q quarters, d dimes, p pennies. If we use q-1 quarters instead, then the remaining amount is N -25(q-1) = N -25q +25 = (N -25q) +25. Since N -25q is the amount left after q quarters, which is less than 25. So, remaining amount after q-1 quarters is (N -25q) +25 = (N mod 25) +25. Wait, but N mod 25 is N -25q. So, remaining amount is (N mod 25) +25. Which is between 25 and 50 (since N mod 25 is less than 25). So, after using q-1 quarters, the remaining amount is between 25 and 50 cents.\n\nThen, how would the greedy algorithm handle that remaining amount? For the remaining amount S (25 ≤ S < 50), the greedy approach would use two 10s (20 cents) and then S -20 pennies. So, total coins would be (q-1) + 2 + (S -20). But S = (N mod25) +25. So, S -20 = (N mod25) +5. Therefore, total coins would be (q-1) +2 + (N mod25 +5) = q -1 +2 + N mod25 +5 = q + N mod25 +6.\n\nCompare this to the original greedy coins: q + d + p. Since original remaining amount after q quarters is N mod25. So, d = floor((N mod25)/10), p = N mod25 -10d. So, original coins: q + d + p = q + (d + p). Since p = (N mod25 -10d), so d + p = d + (N mod25 -10d) = N mod25 -9d. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, p = N mod25 -10d. So, d + p = d + (N mod25 -10d) = N mod25 -9d. But N mod25 is between 0 and24. So, d can be 0,1,2 (since 10*2=20 ≤24). So, for N mod25:\n\nIf N mod25 is between 0-9: d=0, p=N mod25. So, d + p = N mod25.\n\nIf N mod25 is between10-19: d=1, p=N mod25 -10. So, d + p =1 + (N mod25 -10) = N mod25 -9.\n\nIf N mod25 is between20-24: d=2, p=N mod25 -20. So, d + p=2 + (N mod25 -20) = N mod25 -18.\n\nTherefore, original coins: q + (d + p) = q + [N mod25 -9d]. But since d is floor((N mod25)/10), so:\n\nOriginal coins: q + (N mod25 -9d).\n\nBut in the alternative approach (using q-1 quarters), coins are q + N mod25 +6 -1? Wait, earlier calculation was:\n\nAlternative coins: (q-1) + 2 + (N mod25 +5) = q -1 +2 + N mod25 +5 = q + N mod25 +6.",
    "Wait, but original coins: q + (N mod25 -9d). So, comparing q + N mod25 -9d vs. q + N mod25 +6 -1? Wait, no. Wait, original coins: q + (d + p) = q + (N mod25 -9d). Alternative coins: (q -1) + (d' + p'), where d' and p' are the dimes and pennies after using q -1 quarters.\n\nWait, maybe my earlier calculation was incorrect. Let's recast.\n\nOriginal coins: q (quarters) + d (dimes) + p (pennies) = q + d + p.\n\nAlternative approach: (q -1) quarters, then handle the remaining amount S = N -25(q -1) = N -25q +25 = (N mod25) +25.\n\nSo, S is between25 and50 (exclusive). For S, the greedy approach would be to use as many 10s as possible. So, d' = floor(S /10). But S is between25 and50. So, floor(S/10) would be 2,3,4 (since 25/10=2.5→2, 49/10=4.9→4). Wait, S ranges from25 to49 inclusive. So, floor(S/10) is 2,3,4.\n\nWait, S=25: floor(25/10)=2, remainder 5. So, d'=2, p'=5.

Since S = (N mod25) +25, so substituting: q + (N mod25 +25) -19 = q + N mod25 +6.\n\nIf S=30-39: d'=3, p'=S-30. Coins:3 + (S-30) = S -27. Total coins: (q-1) + S -27 = q -1 + S -27 = q + S -28.

Wait, subtract 3? Wait, original coins for case1 (r=5-9) is q + r. Alternative coins (since r=5-9, S=25 + r=30-34, which falls into S=30-39, so alternative coins q + r -3). So, comparing q + r vs q + r -3. So, alternative is better by 3 coins. Wait, but that contradicts. Wait, original coins for r=5-9 (case1) is q + r. Alternative coins would be q + r -3. So, if alternative coins are less, then greedy isn't optimal. Therefore, in this case, if r is in 5-9, then using q-1 quarters gives a better result (coins reduced by 3). Therefore, for N where N mod25 is between5-9, the greedy algorithm is not optimal.\n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, N mod25 is r. So, N =25q + r. If r is between5-9, then in the original greedy approach, we use q quarters, 0 dimes, and r pennies. Total coins: q +0 + r = q + r.\n\nBut if we use q-1 quarters, then remaining amount is25 + r. Which is S=25 + r. Since r is between5-9, S=30-34. Then, using 3 dimes (30) and S-30=0-4 pennies. So, coins would be (q-1) +3 + (S-30)= q-1 +3 + (25 + r -30)= q-1 +3 + (r -5)= q + (r -5 +2)= q + r -3. So, total coins: q + r -3. Which is 3 less than original.

Compare original (q + r -9) vs alternative (q + r -3). So, original is q + r -9 vs alternative q + r -3. So, original is better by 6 coins. Therefore, in this case, greedy is better.\n\nWait, no. Wait, original coins for case2 (r=10-19): q + (r -9). So, if r=10-14, original coins q +1 (since r-9=1-5). Alternative coins q + r -3. So, comparing:\n\nOriginal: q + (r -9)\n\nAlternative: q + r -3\n\nDifference: Original - Alternative = (q + r -9) - (q + r -3) = -6. So, original is 6 coins less. Therefore, in this case, original is better, so greedy is optimal.\n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, if r=10-14, then S=25 + r=35-39. For S=35-39, using 3 dimes (30) and p=5-9.

So, r=20-24: q + 2-6. Alternative coins: q + r -12. So:\n\nOriginal coins: q + (r -18)\n\nAlternative coins: q + r -12\n\nDifference: Original - alternative = (q + r -18) - (q + r -12) = -6. So original is worse by 6 coins. So alternative is better.\n\nTherefore, greedy fails for r=5-9,15-24.",
    "Wait, let's check:\n\nFor r=5-9: alternative gives 3 fewer coins.\n\nFor r=15-24: alternative gives 3 or 6 fewer coins.\n\nTherefore, whenever N mod25 is in 5-9 or 15-24, the greedy algorithm is not optimal.",
    "But wait, let's verify with the example given: N=42.\n\n42 divided by25 is1 quarter, remainder17. So r=17, which is in15-19. So according to above, greedy should fail, which it does (greedy uses1+1+7=9 coins, while optimal is4*10 +2*1=6 coins). So that checks out.\n\nAnother example: N=30.",
    "30 mod25=5. So r=5. Greedy would be1 quarter (25) +0 dimes +5 pennies=1+0+5=6 coins. Alternative:0 quarters +3 dimes +0 pennies=3 coins. Wait, but 3 dimes=30. So, actually, coins=3. So, greedy gives6 coins, but optimal is3 coins. So, greedy fails here. So, r=5-9 indeed are failure points.\n\nSimilarly, N=40. mod25=15. So r=15. Greedy:1 quarter +1 dime +5 pennies=1+1+5=7 coins. Alternative:0 quarters +4 dimes=4 coins. So, greedy fails.\n\nN=44: mod25=19. Greedy:1 quarter +1 dime +9 pennies=1+1+9=11 coins. Alternative:0 quarters +4 dimes +4 pennies=8 coins.

Greedy:1 quarter +4 pennies=5 coins. Alternative:0 quarters +2 dimes +9 pennies=11 coins. So, greedy is optimal here.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier analysis, r=5-9 are failure points. Let's check N=30 (r=5): greedy gives1 quarter +5 pennies=6 coins. Optimal is3 dimes=3 coins. So, greedy fails.\n\nN=35: r=10. Greedy:1 quarter +1 dime +0 pennies=1+1+0=2 coins. Wait, 25+10=35. So, coins=2. Optimal. Alternative: q-1=0 quarters, S=35. 3 dimes +5 pennies=8 coins. So, greedy is optimal here. Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, r=10-14: original coins q + (r -9). Here, q=1, r=10. So coins=1 + (10 -9)=2. Alternative coins: q + r -3=1 +10 -3=8. So original is better. So, indeed, greedy works here.\n\nWait, but N=35: using 1 quarter and1 dime is optimal (2 coins). Any other combination would require more coins. So, yes, works.\n\nSimilarly, N=45: mod25=20. Greedy:1 quarter +2 dimes +0 pennies=1+2+0=3 coins. Alternative: q-1=0 quarters, S=45. 4 dimes +5 pennies=9 coins. So, greedy is better. Wait, but according to our analysis, for r=20-24, alternative coins q + r -12. Here, q=1, r=20. Alternative coins=1 +20 -12=9. Original coins: q + r -18=1 +20 -18=3. So, original is better. Therefore, greedy works here. Wait, but according to earlier analysis, r=20-24 should be failure points? Wait, no. Wait, in the analysis, for r=20-24, alternative coins q + r -12 vs original coins q + r -18. So original coins are q + r -18. So, original is better by6 coins. Therefore, greedy is optimal here.",
    "Wait, but N=45: greedy uses1 quarter +2 dimes=3 coins. Alternative approach would be using0 quarters +4 dimes +5 pennies=9 coins. So, greedy is optimal. So, why did earlier analysis say that r=20-24 (which includes r=20) are failure points?\n\nWait, perhaps there was a miscalculation. Wait, let's re-examine:\n\nFor r=20-24:\n\nOriginal coins: q + (r -18). So, if r=20, coins=q +2.\n\nAlternative coins: q + r -12. So, q +20 -12=q +8. Which is worse than original q +2. So, original is better. Therefore, greedy is optimal here.\n\nWait, but earlier reasoning said that when S=40-49 (r=15-24), alternative coins=q + r -12. But if r=20, S=45. Then alternative coins=q-1 +4 +5= q-1 +9= q +8. Original coins=q +2. So, original is better.\n\nWait, so perhaps my previous conclusion was wrong. Wait, no. Wait, if N=45, q=1, r=20. Original coins:1 +2=3. Alternative coins:0 +4 +5=9. So, original is better. Therefore, for r=20-24, greedy is still optimal. Then, where does the failure occur?\n\nWait, maybe my earlier analysis was incorrect. Let's check N=40:\n\nN=40: mod25=15. So, r=15. Greedy:1 quarter +1 dime +5 pennies=7 coins. Alternative:0 quarters +4 dimes=4 coins. So, alternative is better. So, here, r=15.\n\nOriginal coins: q + (r -9)=1 +15 -9=7.\n\nAlternative coins: q + r -12=1 +15 -12=4.\n\nSo, alternative is better here. Therefore, for r=15-19, alternative is better. Similarly, for r=5-9, alternative is better.\n\nFor r=20-24:\n\nOriginal coins: q + (r -18). For r=20: q +2.\n\nAlternative coins: q + r -12= q +8.\n\nSo, original is better. Therefore, for r=20-24, greedy is optimal.",
    "Wait, so correction: failures occur when r=5-9 and r=15-19. For r=20-24, greedy is still optimal.\n\nSimilarly, let's check N=49:\n\nN=49. mod25=24. Greedy:1 quarter +2 dimes +4 pennies=1+2+4=7 coins. Alternative: q-1=0 quarters, S=49. 4 dimes +9 pennies=13 coins. So, greedy is better. So, original coins=7 vs alternative=13. So, greedy is optimal here.\n\nWait, but according to the earlier analysis, when r=24 (which is in20-24), alternative coins=q +24 -12=q +12. But q=1 here. So alternative coins=1 +24 -12=13, which matches. Original coins=q +24 -18=1 +6=7. So, original is better.\n\nTherefore, conclusion: the greedy algorithm fails when N mod25 is between5-9 or15-19. So, for N where r=5-9 or15-19, greedy is not optimal.\n\nTherefore, the values of N where greedy fails are those where N mod25 is in5-9 or15-19. Therefore, for each 25 block, there are10 values where greedy fails (5-9:5 numbers,15-19:5 numbers). Therefore, in each 25 numbers, 10 are failures. So, total failures from1 to1000 would be floor(1000 /25)*10 + extra in the last partial block.\n\nWait, but let's confirm:\n\nEach cycle of25 numbers (0-24) has10 failure points:5-9 and15-19. So, per 25 numbers,10 failures. So, from1 to1000, how many complete cycles are there?\n\n1000 divided by25 is40. So,40 complete cycles (25*40=1000). So, each cycle contributes10 failures, so40*10=400 failures. But wait, but N is from1 to1000 inclusive. Wait, but cycles are0-24,25-49,...,975-999. Then, the 1000th is part of the next cycle, but1000 mod25=0. So,1000 is part of the last cycle as N=1000=25*40. So,1000 is included. Since each cycle from25k+1 to25k+25, but since N starts at1, perhaps the first cycle is1-25, second26-50, etc. So, total cycles:40. Each cycle has10 failure points (N where N mod25 is5-9 or15-19). Therefore, total failures=40*10=400. Therefore, total successes=1000 -400=600.",
    "Wait, but wait. Let's check with smaller numbers.\n\nFor example, N from1 to25:",
    "Failures are N=5-9 and15-19. That's10 numbers. So,25-10=15 successes. But let's check:\n\nN=1-4: greedy is optimal.",
    "N=5: greedy uses0 quarters,0 dimes,5 pennies=5 coins. But optimal is1 nickel (if existed), but since we don't have nickels, but wait, coins are1,10,25. So, N=5:5 pennies. There's no alternative. So, greedy is the same as minimal. Wait, but according to earlier analysis, N=5 (r=5) should be a failure. Wait, contradiction.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, earlier analysis assumes that when you use q-1 quarters, you can compensate with dimes and pennies. But for N=5:\n\nq=0 (since5 <25). So, q-1 would be-1, which is invalid. Therefore, the earlier analysis applies only when q≥1. So, when q≥1, i.e., N≥25.\n\nTherefore, the failure points occur only when N≥25 and N mod25 is5-9 or15-19.\n\nTherefore, for N from1 to24, the greedy algorithm is always optimal, because they cannot use any quarters. So, for N=1-24, greedy uses as many dimes as possible (if N≥10) then pennies. Since dimes are the highest denomination after quarters, but for N<25, quarters can't be used, so greedy is using dimes and pennies. But since dimes are 10, and pennies are1, the greedy algorithm here is equivalent to using as many dimes as possible, then pennies. Which is optimal because using more dimes reduces the number of coins. For example, N=10:1 dime vs10 pennies. So, greedy is optimal.",
    "Wait, but N=15: greedy uses1 dime and5 pennies=6 coins. Alternatively,15 pennies=15 coins. So, greedy is optimal. Similarly, N=20:2 dimes=2 coins. Optimal. N=24:2 dimes +4 pennies=6 coins. Optimal.\n\nTherefore, for N=1-24, greedy is always optimal. Therefore, the failures start atN=25.\n\nWait, N=25: greedy is1 quarter=1 coin. Optimal. So, works.\n\nN=26:1 quarter +1 penny=2 coins. Optimal.\n\nN=29:1 quarter +4 pennies=5 coins. Optimal.\n\nN=30: greedy would be1 quarter +0 dimes +5 pennies=6 coins. But optimal is3 dimes=3 coins. So, here, N=30 is the first failure. So, N=30 is25+5. So, r=5. So, in this case, q=1. So, q≥1.\n\nTherefore, the failures start atN=25+5=30, up to25+9=34, then25+15=40 up to25+19=44. Then next cycle:50+5=55 to50+9=59,50+15=65 to50+19=69, etc.\n\nTherefore, for N≥25, failures occur when N mod25 is5-9 or15-19.\n\nTherefore, total number of failures:\n\nFrom25 to1000 inclusive, how many N satisfy N mod25 ∈{5,6,7,8,9,15,16,17,18,19}.\n\nEach block of25 numbers (e.g.,25-49) contains10 failures. The total number of blocks from25 to1000 is(1000 -25 +1)/25= (976)/25=39.04. Wait, but25*39=975, so25-975 is39 blocks (25-49,50-74,...,975-999). Then,1000 is the next number, which is25*40=1000. So, total blocks=40. But starting from25:\n\nFirst block:25-49 (25 numbers)\n\n...\n\n40th block:25*40=1000.\n\nBut1000 is a single number. So, total blocks:40, but the last block is only1 number (1000). But1000 mod25=0, which is a success.\n\nTherefore, failures are in the first39 blocks (25-999), each contributing10 failures, plus check if1000 is a failure (it's not). So, total failures=39*10=390.\n\nBut wait, earlier calculation said40 cycles, but if starting from25, each cycle is25 numbers. But1000 is25*40, so the 40th block is975-999 and1000. Wait, no.

Using39 quarters leaves25 cents, which would need2 dimes and5 pennies:39 +2 +5=46 coins, which is worse. So, greedy is optimal. So, no failure at1000.\n\nTherefore, total failures=390.\n\nBut from1-24, all are optimal (24 numbers). Then, from25-999:39*25=975 numbers, of which390 are failures.

So, in each block, residues5-9 correspond toN=5-9,15-19 in the first block (1-25), but N=5-9 are5-9, N=15-19 are15-19. So, in the first block (1-25), the bad N's are5-9 and15-19: total10 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, in the next block26-50, residues1-24 and0 correspond toN=26-50.

Similarly, each subsequent block up to976-1000 has10 failures. Therefore, total failures=40*10=400. Therefore, total successes=1000 -400=600.",
