Then, in each pair, the letters are placed next to each other in alphabetical order to form six two-letter words. Then these six words are listed alphabetically. We need to find the probability that the last word in this list contains the letter G. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.\n\nHmm. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: 12 letters, each paired randomly. So, the total number of possible pairings is... Well, when pairing n items, the number of ways is (n-1)!! if n is even. Here n=12, so total pairings would be 11!! = 11×9×7×5×3×1. Let me confirm: 11!! = 11×9×7×5×3×1 = 10395. Wait, but maybe I need to think differently. The total number of ways to partition 12 distinct elements into 6 unordered pairs is 12!/(2^6 * 6!). Let me check that formula. Yes, because for each pair, we divide by 2! since the order within the pair doesn't matter, and then divide by 6! since the order of the pairs doesn't matter. So total pairings are 12!/(2^6 * 6!) = 10395. So that's correct. So total possible groupings are 10395.\n\nNow, each pair is ordered alphabetically. So, for example, if a pair is G and D, it becomes DG. Then, these six two-letter words are listed alphabetically. So, the list is sorted, and we need the probability that the last word in this sorted list contains G.",

Wait, no: pairs are ordered alphabetically. So if K is paired with J, the pair is JK ordered as JK? No, wait: alphabetical order. J comes before K, so if paired together, the pair is JK. Similarly, if K is paired with A, the pair is AK. So the pair containing K will start with K only if paired with L. Otherwise, it starts with a lower letter.\n\nTherefore, the lex greatest pair is KL if K and L are paired. Otherwise, the lex greatest pair is the pair containing L, which would be JL, IL, HL, GL, FL, etc., depending on who L is paired with. Wait, no: If K is paired with someone else, say J, forming JK, then JK is a pair starting with J. But L is still in the set and must be paired with someone else. If L is paired with I, forming IL, then IL starts with I. So the maximum pair would be JK (starting with J) and IL (starting with I). So JK is higher. Therefore, the maximum pair is JK.",

The highest letter is L. The maximum pair is KL if K and L are paired. Probability 1/11.\n\n2. If K is not paired with L (probability 10/11), then K is paired with someone else (A-J). The remaining letters include L. Now, the maximum pair among the remaining letters is determined by the next highest letter, which is J. The maximum pair is JL if J is paired with L. Probability 1/9 (since there are 10 letters left, L can pair with 9 others).\n\n3. If J is not paired with L (probability 8/9), then the maximum pair is IL if I is paired with L. Probability 1/7.\n\n4. Continuing this way, the probability that L is paired with J, I, H, etc., down to G.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the maximum pair is GL is the probability that K is not paired with L (10/11), and J is not paired with L (8/9), and I is not paired with L (6/7), and H is not paired with L (4/5), and G is paired with L (1/3).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nAfter K is paired with someone else (probability 10/11), we have 10 letters left, including L. The probability that L is paired with J is 1/9. If not (probability 8/9), then L is among 8 letters. Then the probability that L is paired with I is 1/7. If not (probability 6/7), then probability L is paired with H is 1/5.

Therefore, this is the probability that the maximum pair is GL.\n\nBut in this case, GL would be the maximum pair only if all other pairs are lower. However, after pairing K with someone else, and L with G, the remaining letters are paired among themselves. But if there are higher letters than G remaining, their pairs could form higher words.\n\nWait, no. Once K is paired with someone else, and L is paired with G, the remaining letters are A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J (assuming K was paired with someone else, say X, and L paired with G). Wait, no: Original letters are A-L. K is paired with someone else (not L), say W. Then L is paired with G. So remaining letters are A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, and the partner of K. Wait, this is getting too complicated.\n\nBut according to our earlier reasoning, if we pair L with G, then GL is formed. The remaining pairs must be such that none of them form a higher pair than GL. However, letters H, I, J are still present and can form pairs like HI, HJ, IJ, etc. These pairs start with H, I, J, which are higher than G. Therefore, even if L is paired with G, forming GL, if H is paired with I, forming HI, which starts with H, then HI is higher than GL. Therefore, GL would not be the maximum pair.\n\nTherefore, our previous calculation is incorrect because even if L is paired with G, there might still be higher pairs among the remaining letters.\n\nThis suggests that our initial approach is flawed because we didn't consider that pairing L with G doesn't necessarily make GL the maximum pair.\n\nThis is a critical mistake. Therefore, we need to rethink.\n\nThe correct approach must ensure that when we pair G with L, all other pairs are such that none of them form a higher pair than GL. But since there are letters higher than G (H, I, J) remaining, unless they are paired in a way that their pairs start with lower letters.\n\nBut H, I, J can be paired with each other or with lower letters. If H is paired with I, HI starts with H. If H is paired with J, HJ starts with H. If I is paired with J, IJ starts with I. All of these are higher than GL.\n\nTherefore, pairing L with G cannot result in GL being the maximum pair unless all H, I, J are paired with letters lower than G, so their pairs start with lower letters. For example, if H is paired with A, forming AH; I paired with B, BI; J paired with C, CJ. Then, the pairs AH, BI, CJ start with A, B, C, which are lower than G. In this case, GL would be the maximum pair.\n\nTherefore, the probability that GL is the maximum pair is the probability that L is paired with G AND all of H, I, J are paired with letters lower than G.\n\nBut this seems very low. Let's compute this probability.\n\nFirst, pair K with someone else (not L): probability 10/11.\n\nThen, pair L with G: probability 1/10 (since there are 10 letters left after pairing K, and L can pair with any of them).\n\nThen, pair H, I, J with letters lower than G (A-F). There are 6 letters lower than G: A, B, C, D, E, F.",

So remaining letters are A-F minus K's partner, plus H, I, J, L, G. Wait, L is paired with G, so remaining letters are A-F minus K's partner minus G, plus H, I, J.\n\nBut G is paired with L, so G is already out. L is paired with G, so L is already out. K is paired with a lower letter, so K is out. So remaining letters are:\n\nA-F minus K's partner (1) minus G (1) = 4 letters.\n\nPlus H, I, J: 3 letters.\n\nTotal remaining letters: 4 + 3 = 7 letters. Which is odd, so impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the approach.\n\nThis indicates that the previous reasoning is flawed. The correct approach must account for all pairings without leaving an odd number of letters.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct way is to recognize that for G to be in the last pair, G must be paired with L, and all letters higher than G (H, I, J, K) must be paired among themselves or with letters lower than G. This ensures that no pair starting with H, I, J, or K exists, making GL the highest pair.\n\nThe number of ways to pair H, I, J, K among themselves or with letters lower than G:\n\nLetters higher than G: H, I, J, K (4 letters).\n\nLetters lower than G: A, B, C, D, E, F (6 letters).\n\nWe need to pair the 4 higher letters with each other or with the 6 lower letters. The total number of ways to do this is the number of ways to pair 4 higher letters and 6 lower letters into pairs, ensuring that each higher letter is either paired with another higher letter or with a lower letter.\n\nHowever, GL must be paired, so L is already paired with G. Wait, no: L is paired with G in this scenario. So L is not among the higher letters anymore. The higher letters are H, I, J, K.\n\nSo, to ensure that none of H, I, J, K form a pair starting with themselves, they must be paired with someone higher or lower. But since they are the highest remaining letters, they can only be paired with each other or lower letters.\n\nIf they are paired with each other, the pair starts with the lower of the two. For example, pairing H with I gives HI, starting with H. Pairing H with K gives HK, starting with H. Pairing I with K gives IK, starting with I.\n\nTherefore, pairing higher letters among themselves still results in pairs starting with H, I, or J, which are higher than G. Therefore, to prevent any pair from starting with H, I, J, or K, these letters must be paired with lower letters (A-F).\n\nTherefore, all four letters H, I, J, K must be paired with lower letters (A-F). This ensures that their pairs start with the lower letters.\n\nThe number of ways to pair H, I, J, K with A-F:\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the number of ways to pair 4 distinct higher letters with 6 distinct lower letters, allowing each higher letter to choose a lower letter partner, with no overlaps.\n\nThis is a matching problem. The number of ways is P(6,4) = 6*5*4*3 = 360.\n\nThen, the remaining lower letters (6 - 4 = 2) can be paired among themselves in 1 way.\n\nThe remaining higher letters (4 - 4 = 0) are already paired.\n\nTherefore, the total number of favorable pairings is:\n\nPair L with G: 1 way.\n\nPair K, H, I, J with A-F: 360 ways.\n\nPair the remaining 2 lower letters: 1 way.\n\nPair the remaining letters (none left).\n\nTotal favorable pairings: 1 * 360 * 1 = 360.\n\nBut wait, the total number of pairings where L is paired with G and H, I, J, K are paired with A-F is 360. However, we also need to pair the remaining letters after pairing L-G and H, I, J, K with A-F. The remaining letters are A-F minus the 4 paired with H, I, J, K. So 6 - 4 = 2 lower letters, which are paired together. So yes, 1 way.\n\nBut the total number of pairings of the entire set where L is paired with G and H, I, J, K are paired with A-F is:\n\nNumber of ways to pair L with G: 1.\n\nNumber of ways to pair H, I, J, K with A-F: P(6,4) = 360.\n\nNumber of ways to pair the remaining 2 lower letters: 1.\n\nNumber of ways to pair the remaining letters (A-F - 4 paired with H, I, J, K - L and G): already done.\n\nBut the total number of pairings is 12!/(2^6 * 6!) = 10395.\n\nBut wait, the total number of favorable pairings is:\n\n1 (L-G) * [6*5*4*3 (pairing H, I, J, K with A-F)] * [1 (pairing remaining 2 lower letters)] * [pairing K with someone else? No, K is already paired with a lower letter.]\n\nWait, K is one of the higher letters being paired with a lower letter. So K is paired with a lower letter, H, I, J are paired with lower letters, L is paired with G, and the remaining two lower letters are paired together.\n\nTherefore, the total number of favorable pairings is:\n\n1 * 6*5*4*3 * 1 = 360.\n\nBut total pairings is 10395.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 360 / 10395.\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 15: 360 ÷ 15 = 24, 10395 ÷ 15 = 693.\n\n24/693. Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 8/231.\n\nSo the probability is 8/231.",

The discrepancy arises because the two approaches are counting different things.\n\nIn the first approach, we considered the number of favorable pairings as 360, leading to 360/10395 = 8/231.\n\nIn the second approach, using sequential probability, we arrived at 1/154.\n\nWhich is correct?\n\nLet's compute 8/231 and 1/154:\n\n8/231 ≈ 0.0346\n\n1/154 ≈ 0.00649\n\nThese are different by a factor of about 5.34.\n\nThe mistake must be in one of the approaches.\n\nLet's re-examine the first approach.\n\nTotal favorable pairings:\n\n1. Pair L with G: 1 way.\n\n2. Pair K, H, I, J with A-F: P(6,4) = 6*5*4*3 = 360 ways.\n\n3.

However, in reality, once L is paired with G and K is paired with a lower letter, the remaining pool changes, affecting the probabilities.\n\nBut the first approach counts all possible permutations of pairing K, H, I, J with A-F, which is correct. However, the total number of pairings is 10395, and the favorable is 360, leading to 360/10395=8/231.\n\nBut the sequential probability calculation gives a different result. This suggests that one of the approaches is wrong.\n\nLet's compute 8/231 and 1/154:\n\n8/231 = (8 ÷ 7)/(231 ÷ 7) = 8/231 ≈ 0.0346\n\n1/154 ≈ 0.00649\n\nThe difference is significant. Which is correct?\n\nLet's take a small example to test.\n\nSuppose we have letters A, B, C, D. Pair them randomly. What's the probability that A is in the last pair (lex greatest pair)?\n\nPossible pairings:\n\nAB, CD\n\nAC, BD\n\nAD, BC\n\nBA, CD\n\nBC, AD\n\nBD, AC\n\nCA, BD\n\nCB, AD\n\nCD, AB\n\nDA, BC\n\nDB, AC\n\nDC, AB\n\nTotal 3 pairings, each with two orders. Total pairings: 3.\n\nBut lex order: pairs are sorted. So last pair is the greatest.\n\nFor example:\n\nPairing AB, CD: sorted as AB, CD. Last pair CD contains D.\n\nPairing AC, BD: sorted as AC, BD. Last pair BD contains D.\n\nPairing AD, BC: sorted as AD, BC. Last pair AD contains A and D.\n\nSo in this case, the probability that A is in the last pair is 1/3 (only when AD is the pair).\n\nBut according to the first approach:\n\nTotal favorable pairings where A is paired with D: 1.\n\nTotal pairings: 3.\n\nProbability 1/3.\n\nAccording to sequential probability:\n\nProbability A pairs with D: 1/3.\n\nGiven that, the remaining pair is B and C. Probability that BC is the pair: 1.\n\nTotal probability: 1/3 * 1 = 1/3.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nIf we use the second approach:\n\nProbability A pairs with D: 1/3.\n\nProbability B pairs with C: 1/1.\n\nTotal probability: 1/3.\n\nCorrect.\n\nBut if we applied the second approach to the original problem:\n\nProbability L pairs with G: 1/11.\n\nProbability K pairs with lower: 6/10.\n\nProbability H pairs with lower: 5/9.\n\nProbability I pairs with lower: 4/8.\n\nProbability J pairs with lower: 3/7.\n\nMultiply: 1/11 * 6/10 * 5/9 * 4/8 * 3/7 = 1/154.\n\nBut this doesn't match the first approach. Why?\n\nBecause in the small example, once A is paired with D, the remaining pair is forced. But in the original problem, after pairing L with G and K with a lower letter, there are still H, I, J to pair with lowers, but the available lowers decrease each time.\n\nHowever, the first approach counts all possible ways to pair H, I, J, K with lowers, while the second approach multiplies the probabilities sequentially, which should give the same result. But they don't.\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the first approach.\n\nWait, the total number of favorable pairings is not 360. Because when pairing H, I, J, K with lowers, K is one of the higher letters. So pairing K with a lower letter is part of the process.\n\nBut in the first approach, we counted pairing K, H, I, J with lowers as permutations P(6,4) = 360. However, this assumes that K, H, I, J are distinguishable and the lowers are distinguishable. But in reality, the pairings are unordered.\n\nThe correct number of ways to pair H, I, J, K with A-F is:\n\nChoose 4 distinct lower letters and pair them with H, I, J, K.\n\nNumber of ways: C(6,4) * 4! = 15 * 24 = 360.\n\nYes, this matches.\n\nThen pair the remaining 2 lower letters: 1 way.\n\nSo total favorable pairings: 360.\n\nTotal pairings: 10395.\n\n360/10395 = 8/231.\n\nBut according to the sequential probability approach, it's 1/154.\n\nThis discrepancy must be resolved.\n\nWait, the sequential probability approach is incorrect because it assumes independence at each step, but the available pool changes after each pairing.\n\nFor example, after pairing K with a lower letter, the number of available lower letters decreases, affecting the subsequent probabilities.\n\nHowever, the first approach correctly counts the total number of favorable pairings by considering all possible assignments at once, which is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the correct probability is 8/231.\n\nBut wait, let's check with another method.\n\nThe probability that L is paired with G is 1/11.\n\nGiven that L is paired with G, the probability that K is paired with a lower letter is 6/10.\n\nGiven that, the probability that H is paired with a lower letter is 5/8 (since after pairing K with a lower letter, there are 5 lower letters left and 8 remaining letters: H, I, J, and 5 lowers).\n\nWait, no: After pairing L with G and K with a lower letter, we have 12 - 4 = 8 letters left.\n\nThese 8 letters consist of H, I, J and 5 lower letters (A-F minus K's partner).\n\nSo the probability that H is paired with a lower letter is 5/7 (since H can pair with 7 remaining letters: I, J, and 5 lowers).\n\nSimilarly, after pairing H with a lower letter, the probability that I is paired with a lower letter is 4/5 (4 lowers left, 5 letters: I, J, and 3 lowers).\n\nThen, the probability that J is paired with a lower letter is 3/3 = 1.\n\nMultiply these probabilities:\n\n1/11 * 6/10 * 5/7 * 4/5 * 1 =\n\n(1/11) * (6/10) * (5/7) * (4/5) * 1 =\n\n(1/11) * (6/10) * (4/7) * 1 =\n\n(1/11) * (24/70) =\n\n24/770 =\n\n12/385 ≈ 0.03116.\n\nThis is different from both previous results.\n\nClearly, there's confusion in the approaches. This suggests that the problem is more complex and requires a more careful combinatorial analysis.\n\nAnother approach: Use linearity of expectation. Let's consider the probability that G is in the last pair. For each pair that includes G, compute the probability that this pair is the last one, and sum over all possible pairs containing G.",

    "\n\nOkay, let's see. So, there are twelve letters from A to L, right? They need to be randomly grouped into six pairs. Then, in each pair, the letters are placed next to each other in alphabetical order to form six two-letter words. Then these six words are listed alphabetically. We need to find the probability that the last word in this list contains the letter G. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.\n\nHmm. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: 12 letters, each paired randomly. So, the total number of possible pairings is... Well, when pairing n items, the number of ways is (n-1)!! if n is even. Here n=12, so total pairings would be 11!! = 11×9×7×5×3×1. Let me confirm: 11!! = 11×9×7×5×3×1 = 10395. Wait, but maybe I need to think differently. The total number of ways to partition 12 distinct elements into 6 unordered pairs is 12!/(2^6 * 6!). Let me check that formula. Yes, because for each pair, we divide by 2! since the order within the pair doesn't matter, and then divide by 6! since the order of the pairs doesn't matter. So total pairings are 12!/(2^6 * 6!) = 10395. So that's correct. So total possible groupings are 10395.\n\nNow, each pair is ordered alphabetically. So, for example, if a pair is G and D, it becomes DG. Then, these six two-letter words are listed alphabetically. So, the list is sorted, and we need the probability that the last word in this sorted list contains G.",
    "So, the key here is to find the probability that G is in the last pair when all pairs are ordered alphabetically. Wait, but the pairs themselves are ordered alphabetically first, then the words are sorted. Wait, no: each pair is ordered alphabetically to form a word, then the six words are sorted alphabetically. So the entire list is sorted alphabetically, so the last word is the one that comes last in alphabetical order.\n\nSo, the question reduces to: What's the probability that G is in the pair that forms the alphabetically last word.",
    "But wait, the alphabetically last word would be the one with the highest starting letter. Since letters go from A to L, the highest starting letter is L. But L can't form a pair with any higher letter, since L is the last. So the highest possible starting letter for a word is K, since K-L would form KL, which is the highest possible word. Wait, no: KL is a word, but K is before L. Wait, but pairs are ordered alphabetically, so KL would be KL if K is paired with L. But if K is paired with, say, A, then it's AK. So the starting letter of each word depends on the pairing.",
    "Wait, the alphabetically last word would be the one with the highest first letter. If two words have the same first letter, then the second letter determines. So, for example, KL would come after KJ because L comes after J. So, the last word is the pair where the first letter is the highest possible, and if there are multiple pairs starting with the same letter, then the second letter is the highest.",
    "Therefore, to have G in the last word, G must be either the first or second letter in that pair. But since the pair is ordered alphabetically, G can only be the second letter if it's paired with a letter that comes after G. Wait, no: If G is paired with a letter that comes after G, then the pair would be G followed by the other letter, right? Wait, no: If G is paired with H, then since G comes before H, the pair is GH. If G is paired with F, then FG. So, G can be either the first or second letter in a pair depending on its partner.\n\nBut the key is that the last word in the sorted list is the lexicographically last word. So, the last word would be the pair that is lexicographically largest. Therefore, the last word is determined by the pair with the highest starting letter. If there are multiple pairs starting with the same highest letter, then the one with the highest second letter.\n\nSo, to find the probability that G is in this last pair, we need to consider that either:\n\n1. G is part of the lexicographically last pair. So, either G is paired with a letter that allows the pair to be the last one.\n\nBut how do we compute this probability? Let's think.",
    "First, note that letters A to L are in order. The lexicographically last word will be the pair that starts with the highest possible first letter. The highest first letter possible is K (since L can't be paired with anyone higher, so KL would be a pair, but if K is paired with L, then KL is a word; otherwise, if K is paired with someone else, say J, then KJ, which is still a high word. But KL is higher than KJ. Similarly, L can only be paired with someone else, but since L is the last letter, pairing L with any other letter would result in the pair being [other letter]L, since L is after all others. So, for example, if L is paired with A, the pair is AL; paired with B, BL, etc. So, the pair involving L will always have L as the second letter, so the word is [something]L. Therefore, the highest possible starting letter for a word is K (since KL would be a word starting with K), unless K is paired with L. Wait, KL would start with K, but if K is paired with someone else, say J, then KJ starts with K as well. Similarly, if K is paired with L, then KL is the highest possible word. If K is paired with someone else, then KJ, KK (but there's only one K), etc. Wait, but all letters are distinct. So KL is the highest possible word because K is the highest starting letter, followed by L as the second letter.\n\nWait, let's order the letters: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L.\n\nSo, KL is the highest possible word because K is the 11th letter and L is the 12th. So KL would be higher than any other word starting with K (since L is the highest second letter). Then, if K is not paired with L, then the highest word would be K paired with someone else, say J, making KJ. Then, KJ would be the highest word. Similarly, if K is paired with I, KI, etc. So, KL is the highest possible word.\n\nTherefore, the last word in the list will be KL if K is paired with L. Otherwise, it will be K paired with someone else (J, I, etc.), making KJ, KI, etc., whichever has the highest second letter. Wait, but if K is paired with J, then KJ is higher than KI because J comes after I. So, if K is paired with J, then KJ is higher than KI. Similarly, if K is paired with H, KH, which is lower than KI.\n\nBut regardless, if K is not paired with L, then the highest word will be K paired with the highest available letter. But since L is the highest letter, if K is not paired with L, then L must be paired with someone else, making a word like AL, BL, ..., JL. So, in that case, the highest word would be JL if J is paired with L, which is higher than KL? Wait, no. Wait, JL starts with J, which is before K. So JL would come before KJ. So even if L is paired with J, JL is a word starting with J, which is lower than K. So KJ would still be higher than JL.",
    "Therefore, the highest word is either KL (if K and L are paired) or K paired with the next highest available letter. So, regardless of how K is paired, the highest word will start with K unless K is paired with L, making KL the highest word. Wait, no. Wait, if K is paired with L, KL is the highest word. If K is paired with someone else, say J, then KJ is the highest word. If K is paired with someone lower, like H, then KH is the highest word. Wait, but K is the 11th letter; the next highest letter after K is L. So, if K is paired with L, KL is the highest word. If K is paired with someone else, then KJ (if paired with J), KI (if paired with I), etc. But KJ is higher than KI, which is higher than KH, etc.\n\nBut regardless, the highest word is determined by the pair that has the highest starting letter. Since K is the highest starting letter (since L can't start any pair unless paired with someone higher, which is impossible), so K is the highest starting letter possible. Therefore, the pair that includes K will determine the last word. If K is paired with L, then KL is the last word. If K is paired with someone else, say J, then KJ is the last word. If K is paired with I, KI is last word, etc. Therefore, regardless of who K is paired with, the pair containing K will be the last word. Because K is the highest starting letter.",
    "Wait, but wait: Suppose K is paired with A. Then the pair is AK. But AK starts with A, which is way earlier. Wait, no: Wait, pairs are ordered alphabetically. So if K is paired with A, since A comes before K, the pair is AK. So the word is AK, which starts with A. Therefore, in that case, the pair AK would not be the last word. So, my previous reasoning is flawed.\n\nAh! So here's the mistake. If K is paired with a letter that comes before K, then the pair is ordered with the earlier letter first. Therefore, the word would start with the earlier letter. Therefore, if K is paired with A, the word is AK; if paired with B, BK; up to JK. If paired with L, KL. So, the pair involving K could either start with K (if paired with L) or start with the earlier letter (if paired with anyone before L). Therefore, the starting letter of the pair involving K is either K (if paired with L) or some earlier letter (if paired with someone else). Therefore, the starting letter of the pair involving K is only K if paired with L. Otherwise, it's a lower starting letter.",
    "Therefore, the highest starting letter among all pairs is either K (if K is paired with L) or the highest starting letter among the other pairs. Wait, but if K is paired with someone else, then the pair AK, BK, ..., JK would start with A, B, ..., J. Then, the highest starting letter among all pairs would be J (if J is paired with someone), or I, etc., depending on how the other pairs are formed.",
    "Wait, this complicates things. So, the highest starting letter across all pairs could be K (if K is paired with L) or the next highest available letter if K is paired with someone else.\n\nTherefore, the last word in the list is either KL (if K is paired with L) or the highest pair among the remaining pairs.\n\nTherefore, the problem splits into two cases:\n\n1. K is paired with L. Then, the last word is KL, which contains K and L. So G is not in this pair.",
    "2. K is paired with someone else (not L). Then, the last word is the highest pair among the remaining letters. But in this case, L is still in the pool of letters, paired with someone else. Since L is the highest letter, when paired with any other letter, the pair will be [letter]L, so starting with the lower letter. Therefore, the highest starting letter in the remaining pairs would be J (if J is paired with someone higher than J?), but wait, J is paired with someone. Wait, no: If K is paired with, say, A, then the remaining letters are B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, L. These need to be paired into five pairs. The highest remaining letter is L, but L paired with someone else will start with the other letter. So the highest starting letter among the remaining pairs would be J if J is paired with L (JL), but J comes before L, so JL would start with J. Alternatively, if J is paired with someone lower, then J's pair would start with J if paired with someone higher? Wait, no. If J is paired with L, the pair is JL. If J is paired with, say, M, but there's no M. Wait, letters only go up to L. So, J can be paired with L, making JL, or with someone lower, making GJ, HJ, IJ, JJ (but no duplicate letters), etc. Wait, JJ isn't possible since there's only one J. So, if J is paired with L, then JL is a word starting with J. If J is paired with someone else lower, then the word would start with the lower letter. For example, if J is paired with B, then the pair is BJ. So, starting with B. Therefore, the highest starting letter in the remaining pairs would be J only if J is paired with L. Otherwise, if J is paired with someone lower, then J's pair starts with the lower letter, so J isn't the starting letter.\n\nSimilarly, if L is paired with someone else, say H, then HL. So starting with H. Therefore, the highest starting letter among the remaining pairs would be J if J is paired with L (JL), otherwise, the next highest possible starting letter would be I if I is paired with L (IL), but IL starts with I, which is lower than J. Wait, no: If J is paired with someone else, say K, but K is already paired with A in this case. Wait, this is getting complicated.",
    "Wait, maybe another approach is needed. Let's think about the position of G. We need the probability that G is in the last word when all words are sorted alphabetically. The last word is the lexicographically greatest word.\n\nTo compute this probability, perhaps we can consider the position of G. For G to be in the last word, either:\n\n1. G is paired with a letter higher than G (i.e., H, I, J, K, L), forming a word starting with G. Then, this word would be something like GH, GI, GJ, GK, GL. These words start with G, which is the 7th letter. However, unless all other pairs start with letters lower than G, this word wouldn't be the last. But given that K and L are higher than G, unless K and L are paired in such a way that their pairs don't start with K or L.",
    "Wait, this seems messy. Alternatively, maybe we can think that the last word is determined by the highest possible pair. So, the highest possible pair is KL. If KL exists, then it's the last word. If not, then the next highest possible pair is either KJ, if K is paired with J, or JL if J is paired with L, etc.\n\nBut perhaps instead of considering all possibilities, we can use linearity of expectation or some combinatorial argument.\n\nWait, here's an idea. The probability that G is in the last pair is equal to the probability that G is paired with the \"last possible\" partner. But how to formalize this.",
    "Alternatively, think of all possible pairings. For each pairing, determine the last word and check if it contains G. Then, count the number of pairings where the last word contains G, divide by total pairings (10395), and reduce the fraction.\n\nBut enumerating all pairings is impossible. So, we need a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the last word is the maximum element in the set of six two-letter words. So, we can model this as selecting a random pairing, forming the six words, and then taking the maximum. We need the probability that G is in the maximum word.\n\nIn probability terms, for each letter, the probability that it is in the maximum pair. But how does the maximum pair relate to the letters?",
    "Alternatively, use the concept that the probability a particular element is in the maximum set can sometimes be computed by considering the chances that it is paired with a higher element and that all higher elements are paired among themselves.\n\nWait, similar to the problem where you have people with different heights and you want the probability that the tallest person is in a certain position.",
    "Wait, here's an approach inspired by that. Let's order the letters from lowest to highest: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L.",
    "The maximum word is determined by the pair that is lex greatest. To have G in the maximum word, G must be paired with a letter such that their pair is the maximum. Alternatively, G could be paired with a higher letter, making a word starting with G, but that word would only be the maximum if all higher letters are paired in such a way that their pairs don't form a higher word.\n\nAlternatively, if G is paired with L, then GL would be a word starting with G, but GL would be higher than any word starting with letters after G (H, I, J, K) only if those letters are paired with lower letters. But H, I, J, K paired with lower letters would form words starting with the lower letters. Wait, no. If H is paired with L, HL starts with H. If H is paired with K, HK starts with H. So, unless K is paired with L, KL is higher than GL.",
    "Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe another angle. Let's think recursively. Suppose we consider the highest letter L. If L is paired with K, then KL is the highest word. If L is paired with someone else, say G, then LG becomes GL (since G comes before L), so the word is GL. Then, the highest word would be the maximum among KL (if K is paired with L), or whatever pair K is in.",
    "Wait, perhaps we can use the principle of inclusion here. Let's think about the possible candidates for the last word. The last word could be KL, or if not KL, then KJ, or if not KJ, then KI, etc., down to KA. Alternatively, if K is not paired with L, then the highest word could be JL if J is paired with L, etc. But this seems too vague.",
    "Alternatively, here's a better approach inspired by probability theory. For G to be in the last word, G must be paired with a letter such that their pair is the maximum among all pairs. So, the probability that the pair containing G is the maximum pair.",
    "But the maximum pair is either KL (if K and L are paired) or the pair containing K if K is paired with someone else (since K is the highest starting letter unless paired with L). Wait, no. Wait, if K is paired with L, KL is the maximum. If K is paired with someone else, say J, then KJ is the maximum. If K is paired with someone lower, then KJ would still be higher than any other pair unless J is paired with L. Wait, no. If K is paired with J, then KJ is a word. If J is paired with L, then JL is a word. KJ comes after JL because K comes after J. So KJ is higher.\n\nTherefore, regardless of how K is paired, if K is paired with someone, that pair will be the maximum unless K is paired with L, in which case KL is the maximum. Wait, no. Wait, if K is paired with L, KL is the maximum. If K is paired with J, KJ is the maximum. If K is paired with I, KI is the maximum, etc. So, the pair containing K is always the maximum, unless K is paired with L. Wait, no. Wait, if K is paired with L, KL is the maximum. If K is paired with J, KJ is the maximum. If K is paired with A, AK is the pair, which is much lower. Wait, but AK starts with A, so AK would not be the maximum. Wait, hold on. If K is paired with A, then the pair is AK, which starts with A. Then, the maximum pair would be the pair containing L. Since L is paired with someone else, say B, then BL is the pair. BL starts with B. If L is paired with J, JL starts with J. So, in this case, JL would be higher than AK. Wait, but if K is paired with A, then KJ is not formed; instead, AK is formed, and JL is formed if J is paired with L. So JL would be higher than AK. Therefore, the maximum word in this case would be JL.\n\nWait, so if K is paired with a lower letter, then the maximum word is determined by the remaining letters. Specifically, the remaining letters after pairing K with someone else. So, if K is paired with A, then we have letters B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, L left. Pairing these into five pairs. The maximum pair among these would be JL if J is paired with L, otherwise, IL if I is paired with L, etc.\n\nTherefore, the maximum word is either KL (if K is paired with L), or the maximum pair among the remaining letters after pairing K with someone else. Therefore, the maximum word is KL with probability equal to the probability that K is paired with L, which is 1/11 (since K can pair with any of the 11 other letters, and L is one of them). If K is not paired with L (probability 10/11), then the maximum word is the maximum pair among the remaining 10 letters.\n\nTherefore, recursively, the probability that G is in the last word is equal to the probability that K is paired with L (1/11) times the probability that G is in KL (which is zero, since KL contains K and L) plus the probability that K is not paired with L (10/11) times the probability that G is in the maximum pair of the remaining 10 letters.",
    "Wait, but if K is paired with someone else, then the remaining 10 letters include G. So we need to compute the probability that G is in the maximum pair of the remaining 10 letters. But this seems recursive. Let's define P(n) as the probability that G is in the maximum pair when considering n letters. But maybe not necessary.",
    "Alternatively, let's think step by step. First, pair K. The probability that K is paired with L is 1/11. In this case, the last word is KL, which does not contain G. Therefore, the probability that G is in the last word in this case is 0.\n\nIf K is not paired with L (probability 10/11), then K is paired with someone else (A-J). Then, the remaining letters include L and G. Now, among the remaining 10 letters, the maximum pair is determined by the highest possible pair. The highest remaining letter is L. So, similar to before, the maximum pair among the remaining letters would be JL if J is paired with L, otherwise IL if I is paired with L, etc.",
    "Therefore, in this case, the probability that G is in the maximum pair of the remaining 10 letters is equal to the probability that L is paired with G. Because if L is paired with G, then the pair is GL, which is a word starting with G. But GL would only be the maximum pair if all higher letters (H, I, J, K) are already paired in such a way that their pairs don't form a higher word. Wait, but K is already paired with someone else. So, the remaining letters after pairing K are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, L minus the partner of K. Wait, no: originally, there are 12 letters. If K is paired with someone else (not L), then we have 12 - 2 = 10 letters left, which includes G and L.\n\nSo, among these 10 letters, the maximum pair will be determined by the highest letter, which is L. So, L must be paired with someone. If L is paired with J, then JL is the maximum pair. If paired with I, IL, etc. So, the maximum pair is JL if J is paired with L, otherwise IL, etc. However, if L is paired with G, then GL is the pair. GL starts with G, which is lower than H, I, J. Therefore, GL cannot be the maximum pair unless all pairs involving H, I, J are starting with lower letters.",
    "Wait, no. If L is paired with G, forming GL, then H, I, J are still in the remaining letters. So H, I, J must be paired with others. For example, if H is paired with J, then HJ starts with H. If I is paired with someone else, say F, FI starts with F. So, the maximum pair would be HJ if H is paired with J, or HI if H is paired with I, etc. But HJ starts with H, which is higher than G. Therefore, even if L is paired with G, forming GL, the maximum pair would be HJ or something higher.\n\nTherefore, pairing L with G does not make GL the maximum pair. Therefore, G cannot be in the maximum pair unless G is paired with someone higher than all other possible pairs. But since L is the highest, unless G is paired with L, but even then, GL is not the maximum because H, I, J are still present and can form higher pairs.",
    "Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nIf K is paired with someone else (not L), then we have 10 remaining letters, including G and L. The maximum pair among these 10 letters would be determined by the highest possible starting letter. The letters H, I, J are still present. So, pairs starting with H, I, or J could be higher than GL.\n\nFor example, if H is paired with J, forming HJ, which starts with H. If I is paired with J, forming IJ. Wait, but HJ is higher than IJ because H comes before I. Wait, no: HJ starts with H, IJ starts with I. Since H comes before I, HJ comes before IJ. Wait, no: Alphabetical order is based on the first letter. So HJ comes before IJ because H comes before I. Therefore, the maximum pair would be the one starting with the highest possible first letter.\n\nSo, among the remaining letters (excluding K and its pair), which include H, I, J, L, G, etc., the highest first letter possible is J (if J is paired with L, forming JL), then I (if paired with L, forming IL), etc. Therefore, the maximum pair is JL if J is paired with L; otherwise, IL if I is paired with L; otherwise, HL if H is paired with L; otherwise, FL, EL, etc.\n\nTherefore, the maximum pair among the remaining 10 letters is determined by the highest letter paired with L. So, if L is paired with J, JL is the maximum. If L is paired with I, IL is next, etc. Therefore, the maximum pair is L paired with the highest available letter.\n\nTherefore, among the remaining 10 letters, the maximum pair is L paired with the highest available letter, which is J, then I, then H, etc.\n\nTherefore, the probability that G is in the maximum pair is zero unless G is paired with L. Because if G is paired with L, then GL is the pair. However, GL starts with G, but if L is paired with a higher letter like J, then JL is higher. Therefore, GL can only be the maximum pair if L is not paired with any letter higher than G. But letters higher than G are H, I, J, K. But K is already paired. So letters higher than G remaining are H, I, J. Therefore, if L is paired with any of H, I, J, then the pair starting with H, I, or J will be higher than GL. Therefore, GL can only be the maximum pair if L is paired with G or lower. But G is lower than H, I, J. So, pairing L with G would result in GL, but if L is paired with anyone lower than G (F, E, etc.), then the pair would be FL, EL, etc., which start with F, E, etc., which are lower than G. Wait, but G is paired with L, forming GL. If L is paired with someone lower than G, say F, then FL starts with F. So GL starts with G, which is higher than F. Therefore, GL would be higher than FL. Therefore, if L is paired with G or lower, then GL is the maximum pair. If L is paired with H, I, or J, then HL, IL, JL are higher than GL.\n\nTherefore, in the remaining 10 letters (after pairing K with someone else), the maximum pair is JL if L is paired with J, IL if paired with I, HL if paired with H, or GL if paired with G or lower. Therefore, GL is the maximum pair only if L is paired with G or lower (F, E, D, C, B, A). But letters lower than G are A-F. So, pairing L with G or any of A-F would result in GL, FL, EL, DL, CL, BL, AL. Among these, GL is the highest because G is the highest starting letter. Therefore, if L is paired with G, then GL is the maximum pair. If L is paired with F, then FL is formed, but GL is higher than FL if G is paired with someone else. Wait, no: If L is paired with F, then FL is formed. If G is paired with someone else, say H, then GH is formed. Then, FL and GH are both pairs. FL starts with F, GH starts with G. So GH is higher than FL. Therefore, GH would be higher than FL.",
    "Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let's formalize.",
    "When K is paired with someone else, we have 10 remaining letters: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, L minus the partner of K. Wait, K is paired with one letter, so the remaining letters are 12 - 2 = 10 letters. These include G and L.\n\nIn these 10 letters, the maximum pair is determined by the following:\n\nThe highest possible starting letter is J (if J is present). If J is paired with L, then JL is the maximum. If J is paired with someone else, then the next highest starting letter is I, and so on.",
    "But wait, J is among the remaining letters (since K was paired with someone else). So J is present. Therefore, the maximum pair is JL if J is paired with L; otherwise, IL if I is paired with L; otherwise, HL; otherwise, GL; etc.\n\nTherefore, the probability that GL is the maximum pair is the probability that L is paired with G and that none of J, I, H are paired with L.\n\nTherefore, the maximum pair is GL only if L is paired with G. If L is paired with J, I, or H, then those pairs (JL, IL, HL) would be higher than GL.

Therefore, even if L is paired with F, the maximum pair could be something else.\n\nThis suggests that the maximum pair is not necessarily involving L. If L is paired with a lower letter, then the maximum pair could be among the other pairs.",
    "Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let's think differently.\n\nThe key idea is that the last word is the lex greatest pair. For G to be in that pair, either:",
    "1. G is paired with L, forming GL. Then, GL must be the greatest pair. For GL to be the greatest pair, all other pairs must be such that their words are less than GL.

So K is paired with someone else, forming a word like KA, KB, etc. But KA starts with A, which is lower than G. Similarly, if K is paired with J, KJ starts with K, which is higher than G.

If K is paired with G, then KG becomes GK (since G < K), forming GK, which starts with G, same as GL. GK vs GL: GL is higher because L > K. Wait, no: If K is paired with G, then the pair is GK (since G comes before K). GK starts with G, and GL also starts with G. Comparing GK and GL, GL is higher because L comes after K.",
    "Therefore, even if K is paired with G, forming GK, GL would still be higher if L is paired with G. Wait, but L can only be paired with one person. So if L is paired with G, then K is paired with someone else. If K is paired with G, then L is paired with someone else. So, these are mutually exclusive.\n\nThis is very complicated. Perhaps we need to use the concept of linearity of probability here. Let's consider each letter higher than G (H, I, J, K, L) and calculate the probability that G is paired with one of them, and that their pair is the maximum.",
    "Alternatively, think of the maximum pair as follows: The maximum pair is the pair that contains the highest possible first letter. If two pairs have the same first letter, the one with the higher second letter is greater.\n\nTherefore, the maximum pair is determined first by the highest first letter, then the highest second letter.\n\nTo have G in the maximum pair, G must be paired with a letter such that their pair is greater than all other pairs. This can happen in two ways:\n\n1. G is paired with a letter higher than G (H, I, J, K, L), forming a pair starting with G. For this pair to be the maximum, all other pairs must start with letters less than G.

So, the pairs starting with H, I, J, K, L can only start with those letters if they are paired with a higher letter. But since L is the highest, any pair involving L will start with the other letter. Therefore, pairs starting with H, I, J, K can only exist if they are paired with a higher letter. For example, K can start a pair only if paired with L.

Otherwise, the highest starting letter is J if J is paired with K or L, but K is already paired with someone else. This seems recursive.",
    "Wait, let's try another angle. Let's compute the probability that G is in the last pair by considering all possible pairs that could be the last one and checking if G is in them.\n\nThe last pair can be any pair from the six pairs, but ordered such that it's the lex greatest. To compute the probability that G is in this pair, we can consider each possible pair that includes G and compute the probability that this pair is the lex greatest.\n\nSo, G can be paired with any of the other 11 letters. For each possible pairing of G with another letter, we need to compute the probability that this pair is the lex greatest among all pairs.\n\nBut since all pairings are equally likely, the probability that a specific pair (e.g., GA) is the lex greatest is equal to the number of pairings where GA is the lex greatest divided by the total number of pairings.\n\nHowever, this approach might be too computational.",
    "Alternatively, consider symmetry. There are 12 letters, each equally likely to be paired with any other. The probability that G is in the last pair is equal to the expected number of pairs that contain G and are the last pair. But since there can be only one last pair, the probability is equal to the expected value that G is in the last pair. Which is the same as the probability that G is in the last pair.\n\nBut this doesn't help directly.\n\nWait, here's a better idea from probability theory: For any element, the probability that it is the maximum in a random permutation is 1/n. But this is for permutations. However, in our case, the pairs are not permutations but unordered pairs. However, maybe a similar concept applies.\n\nSuppose we think of the pairs as being formed randomly. The probability that a specific pair is the lex greatest is equal to the probability that both elements of the pair are higher than all other elements, but this is not straightforward.",
    "Alternatively, consider that the lex greatest pair is determined by the two highest letters, unless they are paired together. Wait, this is similar to the problem where the probability that the two tallest people are paired together is 1/(n-1). But not exactly.",
    "Wait, let's think recursively. The lex greatest pair is either the pair containing the highest letter L. If L is paired with K, then KL is the greatest. If L is paired with someone else, say J, then JL is the pair, and then we need to compare with other pairs. But K is still in the set, so if K is paired with someone else, say I, then KI is a pair starting with I. But JL starts with J, which is higher than I. So JL would be greater than KI. But if K is paired with someone higher than J, but there's no one higher than J except K and L. So if K is paired with L, KL is the greatest. If K is paired with someone else, say J, then KJ is the pair starting with K, which is higher than JL. Wait, KJ starts with K, which is higher than J. So KJ is greater than JL.\n\nTherefore, the lex greatest pair is either KL (if K and L are paired) or the pair containing K (if K is paired with someone else). If K is paired with someone else, then the pair containing K is KJ, KI, KH, etc., depending on who K is paired with. The pair containing K will start with K only if K is paired with L. Otherwise, if K is paired with someone lower, then the pair starts with the lower letter. Wait, no: If K is paired with J, the pair is JK ordered as JK (since J < K), so the word is JK. Wait, no: pairs are ordered alphabetically. So if K is paired with J, the pair is JK ordered as JK? No, wait: alphabetical order. J comes before K, so if paired together, the pair is JK. Similarly, if K is paired with A, the pair is AK. So the pair containing K will start with K only if paired with L. Otherwise, it starts with a lower letter.\n\nTherefore, the lex greatest pair is KL if K and L are paired. Otherwise, the lex greatest pair is the pair containing L, which would be JL, IL, HL, GL, FL, etc., depending on who L is paired with. Wait, no: If K is paired with someone else, say J, forming JK, then JK is a pair starting with J. But L is still in the set and must be paired with someone else. If L is paired with I, forming IL, then IL starts with I. So the maximum pair would be JK (starting with J) and IL (starting with I). So JK is higher. Therefore, the maximum pair is JK.",
    "Wait, this is inconsistent. If K is paired with J, forming JK, and L is paired with I, forming IL, then among all pairs, JK is the highest because J is the highest starting letter. Therefore, the maximum pair is JK.\n\nSimilarly, if K is paired with H, forming HK, then HK starts with H. If L is paired with J, forming JL, then JL starts with J, which is higher than H. So JL is higher.",
    "Therefore, the maximum pair is either KL (if K and L are paired), or the maximum between the pair containing K (if K is paired with someone lower) and the pair containing L (if L is paired with someone higher). Wait, this is getting too recursive.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider that the maximum pair is determined by the highest available pair, which depends on how the higher letters are paired.\n\nHere's a structured approach:\n\n1. The highest letter is L. The maximum pair is KL if K and L are paired. Probability 1/11.\n\n2. If K is not paired with L (probability 10/11), then K is paired with someone else (A-J). The remaining letters include L. Now, the maximum pair among the remaining letters is determined by the next highest letter, which is J. The maximum pair is JL if J is paired with L. Probability 1/9 (since there are 10 letters left, L can pair with 9 others).\n\n3. If J is not paired with L (probability 8/9), then the maximum pair is IL if I is paired with L. Probability 1/7.\n\n4. Continuing this way, the probability that L is paired with J, I, H, etc., down to G.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the maximum pair is GL is the probability that K is not paired with L (10/11), and J is not paired with L (8/9), and I is not paired with L (6/7), and H is not paired with L (4/5), and G is paired with L (1/3).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nAfter K is paired with someone else (probability 10/11), we have 10 letters left, including L. The probability that L is paired with J is 1/9. If not (probability 8/9), then L is among 8 letters. Then the probability that L is paired with I is 1/7. If not (probability 6/7), then probability L is paired with H is 1/5. If not (probability 4/5), then probability L is paired with G is 1/3.\n\nSo the total probability that L is paired with G is:\n\n10/11 * 8/9 * 6/7 * 4/5 * 1/3.\n\nBut wait, step by step:\n\n- After pairing K with someone else (10/11), remaining letters: 10, including L.\n\n- Probability L is not paired with J: 8/9 (since L can pair with 9 others, 8 are not J).\n\n- Then, remaining letters: 8, including L.\n\n- Probability L is not paired with I: 6/7.\n\n- Remaining letters: 6, including L.\n\n- Probability L is not paired with H: 4/5.\n\n- Remaining letters: 4, including L.",
    "- Probability L is paired with G: 1/3 (since L can pair with 3 others: G, F, E, D, C, B, A? Wait, no: After pairing K, J, I, H, the remaining letters would be G, F, E, D, C, B, A, L. Wait, this seems off.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is:\n\nTotal remaining letters after each step:\n\nAfter pairing K: 10 letters left (including L).\n\nIf L is not paired with J: 8 letters left (excluding K's pair and J's pair).\n\nIf L is not paired with I: 6 letters left.\n\nIf L is not paired with H: 4 letters left.\n\nIf L is not paired with G: 2 letters left.\n\nWait, but we need to pair L with G. So, the probability that L is paired with G is:\n\nAfter pairing K with someone else: 10 letters left.\n\nProbability L is not paired with J: 8/9.\n\nThen, from the remaining 8 letters (excluding K's pair and J's pair), probability L is not paired with I: 6/7.\n\nFrom remaining 6 letters (excluding K's pair, J's pair, I's pair), probability L is not paired with H: 4/5.\n\nFrom remaining 4 letters (excluding K's pair, J's pair, I's pair, H's pair), probability L is paired with G: 1/3.\n\nBecause there are 4 letters left: G, L, and two others. So, L can pair with G or the two others. So probability is 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is:\n\n10/11 (K not paired with L) *\n\n8/9 (L not paired with J) *\n\n6/7 (L not paired with I) *\n\n4/5 (L not paired with H) *\n\n1/3 (L paired with G) =\n\n(10/11) * (8/9) * (6/7) * (4/5) * (1/3).\n\nLet's compute this:\n\n10/11 * 8/9 = (10*8)/(11*9) = 80/99\n\n80/99 * 6/7 = (80*6)/(99*7) = 480/693\n\n480/693 simplifies to 160/231 by dividing numerator and denominator by 3.\n\n160/231 * 4/5 = (160*4)/(231*5) = 640/1155\n\n640/1155 simplifies to 128/231 by dividing numerator and denominator by 5.\n\n128/231 * 1/3 = 128/693\n\nSo the total probability is 128/693.",
    "But wait, this is the probability that K is not paired with L, and L is ultimately paired with G after not being paired with J, I, H. Therefore, this is the probability that the maximum pair is GL.\n\nBut in this case, GL would be the maximum pair only if all other pairs are lower. However, after pairing K with someone else, and L with G, the remaining letters are paired among themselves. But if there are higher letters than G remaining, their pairs could form higher words.\n\nWait, no. Once K is paired with someone else, and L is paired with G, the remaining letters are A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J (assuming K was paired with someone else, say X, and L paired with G). Wait, no: Original letters are A-L. K is paired with someone else (not L), say W. Then L is paired with G. So remaining letters are A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, and the partner of K. Wait, this is getting too complicated.\n\nBut according to our earlier reasoning, if we pair L with G, then GL is formed. The remaining pairs must be such that none of them form a higher pair than GL. However, letters H, I, J are still present and can form pairs like HI, HJ, IJ, etc. These pairs start with H, I, J, which are higher than G. Therefore, even if L is paired with G, forming GL, if H is paired with I, forming HI, which starts with H, then HI is higher than GL. Therefore, GL would not be the maximum pair.\n\nTherefore, our previous calculation is incorrect because even if L is paired with G, there might still be higher pairs among the remaining letters.\n\nThis suggests that our initial approach is flawed because we didn't consider that pairing L with G doesn't necessarily make GL the maximum pair.\n\nThis is a critical mistake. Therefore, we need to rethink.\n\nThe correct approach must ensure that when we pair G with L, all other pairs are such that none of them form a higher pair than GL. But since there are letters higher than G (H, I, J) remaining, unless they are paired in a way that their pairs start with lower letters.\n\nBut H, I, J can be paired with each other or with lower letters. If H is paired with I, HI starts with H. If H is paired with J, HJ starts with H. If I is paired with J, IJ starts with I. All of these are higher than GL.\n\nTherefore, pairing L with G cannot result in GL being the maximum pair unless all H, I, J are paired with letters lower than G, so their pairs start with lower letters. For example, if H is paired with A, forming AH; I paired with B, BI; J paired with C, CJ. Then, the pairs AH, BI, CJ start with A, B, C, which are lower than G. In this case, GL would be the maximum pair.\n\nTherefore, the probability that GL is the maximum pair is the probability that L is paired with G AND all of H, I, J are paired with letters lower than G.\n\nBut this seems very low. Let's compute this probability.\n\nFirst, pair K with someone else (not L): probability 10/11.\n\nThen, pair L with G: probability 1/10 (since there are 10 letters left after pairing K, and L can pair with any of them).\n\nThen, pair H, I, J with letters lower than G (A-F). There are 6 letters lower than G: A, B, C, D, E, F.",
    "We need to pair H, I, J with these 6 letters. The number of ways to pair H, I, J with A-F is equivalent to matching 3 items with 6 items, which is more complicated. Wait, no: H, I, J are 3 letters that need to be paired with A-F, which are 6 letters. However, we have to pair all remaining letters. After pairing K and L with G, we have:\n\nOriginal letters: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L.\n\nPaired so far: K with someone (not L), L with G.\n\nRemaining letters: A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, and the partner of K.",
    "Wait, partner of K is among A-J (excluding G, since L is paired with G). Wait, no: K was paired with someone else (not L), so K's partner could be any of A-J (since L is excluded). But G is still in the pool until paired with L.",
    "Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let's formalize:\n\nTotal letters: 12.\n\nAfter pairing K with someone else (not L), and L with G, we have:\n\nPaired pairs: K-X (X ≠ L), L-G.\n\nRemaining letters: A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, and X (the partner of K).",
    "Wait, X is someone from A-J (since K was paired with someone else). So remaining letters are 10 - 2 = 8 letters: A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, X. But X is already paired with K, so actually remaining letters are A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J. Wait, no: If K is paired with X (X ≠ L), then X is no longer in the remaining pool. So remaining letters after pairing K-X and L-G are A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J. That's 9 letters. Wait, 12 - 2 (K-X) - 2 (L-G) = 8 letters. Wait, 12 - 4 = 8.

We need to pair each of H, I, J with one of A-F, and then pair the remaining 3 lower letters among themselves.\n\nThe number of ways to pair H, I, J with A-F is:\n\nFirst, choose a partner for H: 6 choices.\n\nThen, partner for I: 5 choices.\n\nThen, partner for J: 4 choices.\n\nThen, the remaining 3 lower letters are paired among themselves: (3-1)!! = 3 ways.\n\nTotal ways: 6*5*4*3 = 360.",

Wait, no: 9 letters cannot be paired into 4 pairs. Wait, 9 letters is an odd number. This suggests a mistake.\n\nWait, original total letters: 12. After pairing K-X and L-G, we have 12 - 2 - 2 = 8 letters left. Wait, yes: 12 letters, subtract 2 pairs (4 letters), leaves 8 letters. So remaining letters: 8 letters, which must be paired into 4 pairs. So 8 letters: A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J minus X. Wait, no: If K is paired with X (one of A-J), then X is no longer in the remaining pool. So remaining letters are A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J minus X. So if X is, say, A, then remaining letters are B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J. If X is B, remaining letters are A, C, D, E, F, H, I, J.

    "Alternatively, realize that this problem is similar to Problem 12 from the 2021 AIME I, but I might be misremembering.

Therefore, there must be a mistake in the approach.\n\nThis indicates that the previous reasoning is flawed. The correct approach must account for all pairings without leaving an odd number of letters.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct way is to recognize that for G to be in the last pair, G must be paired with L, and all letters higher than G (H, I, J, K) must be paired among themselves or with letters lower than G. This ensures that no pair starting with H, I, J, or K exists, making GL the highest pair.\n\nThe number of ways to pair H, I, J, K among themselves or with letters lower than G:\n\nLetters higher than G: H, I, J, K (4 letters).\n\nLetters lower than G: A, B, C, D, E, F (6 letters).\n\nWe need to pair the 4 higher letters with each other or with the 6 lower letters. The total number of ways to do this is the number of ways to pair 4 higher letters and 6 lower letters into pairs, ensuring that each higher letter is either paired with another higher letter or with a lower letter.\n\nHowever, GL must be paired, so L is already paired with G. Wait, no: L is paired with G in this scenario. So L is not among the higher letters anymore. The higher letters are H, I, J, K.\n\nSo, to ensure that none of H, I, J, K form a pair starting with themselves, they must be paired with someone higher or lower. But since they are the highest remaining letters, they can only be paired with each other or lower letters.\n\nIf they are paired with each other, the pair starts with the lower of the two. For example, pairing H with I gives HI, starting with H. Pairing H with K gives HK, starting with H. Pairing I with K gives IK, starting with I.\n\nTherefore, pairing higher letters among themselves still results in pairs starting with H, I, or J, which are higher than G. Therefore, to prevent any pair from starting with H, I, J, or K, these letters must be paired with lower letters (A-F).\n\nTherefore, all four letters H, I, J, K must be paired with lower letters (A-F). This ensures that their pairs start with the lower letters.\n\nThe number of ways to pair H, I, J, K with A-F:\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the number of ways to pair 4 distinct higher letters with 6 distinct lower letters, allowing each higher letter to choose a lower letter partner, with no overlaps.\n\nThis is a matching problem. The number of ways is P(6,4) = 6*5*4*3 = 360.\n\nThen, the remaining lower letters (6 - 4 = 2) can be paired among themselves in 1 way.\n\nThe remaining higher letters (4 - 4 = 0) are already paired.\n\nTherefore, the total number of favorable pairings is:\n\nPair L with G: 1 way.\n\nPair K, H, I, J with A-F: 360 ways.\n\nPair the remaining 2 lower letters: 1 way.\n\nPair the remaining letters (none left).\n\nTotal favorable pairings: 1 * 360 * 1 = 360.\n\nBut wait, the total number of pairings where L is paired with G and H, I, J, K are paired with A-F is 360.

    "But let's check with another approach.\n\nThe probability that L is paired with G is 1/11 (since L has 11 possible partners).\n\nGiven that L is paired with G, the probability that K is paired with a lower letter (A-F) is 6/10 (since K has 10 remaining partners).\n\nGiven that, the probability that H is paired with a lower letter: 5/9 (remaining lower letters: 5).\n\nProbability that I is paired with a lower letter: 4/8 = 1/2.\n\nProbability that J is paired with a lower letter: 3/7.\n\nMultiply all these:\n\n1/11 * 6/10 * 5/9 * 4/8 * 3/7 =\n\n(1/11) * (6/10) * (5/9) * (4/8) * (3/7) =\n\n(1/11) * (3/5) * (5/9) * (1/2) * (3/7) =\n\nSimplify step by step:\n\nFirst, 6/10 = 3/5.\n\nThen, 5/9 stays.\n\nThen, 4/8 = 1/2.\n\nThen, 3/7 stays.\n\nMultiply numerators: 1 * 3 * 5 * 1 * 3 = 45.\n\nMultiply denominators: 11 * 5 * 9 * 2 * 7 = 11*5*9*2*7 = 11*5=55; 55*9=495; 495*2=990; 990*7=6930.\n\nSo 45/6930 = 3/462 = 1/154.",
    "Wait, this contradicts the previous result of 8/231. Clearly, there's a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let's recalculate:\n\n1/11 (L paired with G) *\n\n6/10 (K paired with A-F) *\n\n5/9 (H paired with remaining A-F) *\n\n4/8 (I paired with remaining A-F) *\n\n3/7 (J paired with remaining A-F).\n\nCompute numerator: 1*6*5*4*3 = 360.\n\nDenominator: 11*10*9*8*7 = 55440.\n\n360/55440 = 3/462 = 1/154 ≈ 0.00649.\n\nBut this contradicts the previous result of 8/231 ≈ 0.0346.\n\nClearly, there's a mistake here. The discrepancy arises because the two approaches are counting different things.\n\nIn the first approach, we considered the number of favorable pairings as 360, leading to 360/10395 = 8/231.\n\nIn the second approach, using sequential probability, we arrived at 1/154.\n\nWhich is correct?\n\nLet's compute 8/231 and 1/154:\n\n8/231 ≈ 0.0346\n\n1/154 ≈ 0.00649\n\nThese are different by a factor of about 5.34.\n\nThe mistake must be in one of the approaches.\n\nLet's re-examine the first approach.\n\nTotal favorable pairings:\n\n1. Pair L with G: 1 way.\n\n2. Pair K, H, I, J with A-F: P(6,4) = 6*5*4*3 = 360 ways.\n\n3. Pair remaining 2 lower letters: 1 way.\n\nTotal: 1*360*1 = 360.\n\nTotal pairings: 10395.\n\n360/10395 = 72/2079 = 24/693 = 8/231 ≈ 0.0346.\n\nSecond approach:\n\nProbability L pairs with G: 1/11.\n\nGiven that, probability K pairs with A-F: 6/10.\n\nGiven that, probability H pairs with A-F: 5/9.\n\nGiven that, probability I pairs with A-F: 4/8.\n\nGiven that, probability J pairs with A-F: 3/7.\n\nMultiply: 1/11 * 6/10 * 5/9 * 4/8 * 3/7 = (1*6*5*4*3)/(11*10*9*8*7) = 360/55440 = 1/154.\n\nBut why the discrepancy?\n\nBecause in the first approach, we're counting the number of pairings where L is paired with G and K, H, I, J are paired with A-F. However, in reality, once L is paired with G and K is paired with a lower letter, the remaining pool changes, affecting the probabilities.\n\nBut the first approach counts all possible permutations of pairing K, H, I, J with A-F, which is correct. However, the total number of pairings is 10395, and the favorable is 360, leading to 360/10395=8/231.\n\nBut the sequential probability calculation gives a different result. This suggests that one of the approaches is wrong.\n\nLet's compute 8/231 and 1/154:\n\n8/231 = (8 ÷ 7)/(231 ÷ 7) = 8/231 ≈ 0.0346\n\n1/154 ≈ 0.00649\n\nThe difference is significant. Which is correct?\n\nLet's take a small example to test.\n\nSuppose we have letters A, B, C, D. Pair them randomly. What's the probability that A is in the last pair (lex greatest pair)?\n\nPossible pairings:\n\nAB, CD\n\nAC, BD\n\nAD, BC\n\nBA, CD\n\nBC, AD\n\nBD, AC\n\nCA, BD\n\nCB, AD\n\nCD, AB\n\nDA, BC\n\nDB, AC\n\nDC, AB\n\nTotal 3 pairings, each with two orders. Total pairings: 3.\n\nBut lex order: pairs are sorted. So last pair is the greatest.\n\nFor example:\n\nPairing AB, CD: sorted as AB, CD. Last pair CD contains D.\n\nPairing AC, BD: sorted as AC, BD. Last pair BD contains D.\n\nPairing AD, BC: sorted as AD, BC. Last pair AD contains A and D.\n\nSo in this case, the probability that A is in the last pair is 1/3 (only when AD is the pair).\n\nBut according to the first approach:\n\nTotal favorable pairings where A is paired with D: 1.\n\nTotal pairings: 3.\n\nProbability 1/3.\n\nAccording to sequential probability:\n\nProbability A pairs with D: 1/3.\n\nGiven that, the remaining pair is B and C. Probability that BC is the pair: 1.\n\nTotal probability: 1/3 * 1 = 1/3.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nIf we use the second approach:\n\nProbability A pairs with D: 1/3.\n\nProbability B pairs with C: 1/1.\n\nTotal probability: 1/3.\n\nCorrect.\n\nBut if we applied the second approach to the original problem:\n\nProbability L pairs with G: 1/11.\n\nProbability K pairs with lower: 6/10.\n\nProbability H pairs with lower: 5/9.\n\nProbability I pairs with lower: 4/8.\n\nProbability J pairs with lower: 3/7.\n\nMultiply: 1/11 * 6/10 * 5/9 * 4/8 * 3/7 = 1/154.\n\nBut this doesn't match the first approach. Why?\n\nBecause in the small example, once A is paired with D, the remaining pair is forced. But in the original problem, after pairing L with G and K with a lower letter, there are still H, I, J to pair with lowers, but the available lowers decrease each time.\n\nHowever, the first approach counts all possible ways to pair H, I, J, K with lowers, while the second approach multiplies the probabilities sequentially, which should give the same result. But they don't.\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the first approach.\n\nWait, the total number of favorable pairings is not 360. Because when pairing H, I, J, K with lowers, K is one of the higher letters. So pairing K with a lower letter is part of the process.\n\nBut in the first approach, we counted pairing K, H, I, J with lowers as permutations P(6,4) = 360. However, this assumes that K, H, I, J are distinguishable and the lowers are distinguishable. But in reality, the pairings are unordered.\n\nThe correct number of ways to pair H, I, J, K with A-F is:\n\nChoose 4 distinct lower letters and pair them with H, I, J, K.\n\nNumber of ways: C(6,4) * 4! = 15 * 24 = 360.\n\nYes, this matches.\n\nThen pair the remaining 2 lower letters: 1 way.\n\nSo total favorable pairings: 360.\n\nTotal pairings: 10395.\n\n360/10395 = 8/231.\n\nBut according to the sequential probability approach, it's 1/154.\n\nThis discrepancy must be resolved.\n\nWait, the sequential probability approach is incorrect because it assumes independence at each step, but the available pool changes after each pairing.\n\nFor example, after pairing K with a lower letter, the number of available lower letters decreases, affecting the subsequent probabilities.\n\nHowever, the first approach correctly counts the total number of favorable pairings by considering all possible assignments at once, which is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the correct probability is 8/231.\n\nBut wait, let's check with another method.\n\nThe probability that L is paired with G is 1/11.\n\nGiven that L is paired with G, the probability that K is paired with a lower letter is 6/10.\n\nGiven that, the probability that H is paired with a lower letter is 5/8 (since after pairing K with a lower letter, there are 5 lower letters left and 8 remaining letters: H, I, J, and 5 lowers).\n\nWait, no: After pairing L with G and K with a lower letter, we have 12 - 4 = 8 letters left.\n\nThese 8 letters consist of H, I, J and 5 lower letters (A-F minus K's partner).\n\nSo the probability that H is paired with a lower letter is 5/7 (since H can pair with 7 remaining letters: I, J, and 5 lowers).\n\nSimilarly, after pairing H with a lower letter, the probability that I is paired with a lower letter is 4/5 (4 lowers left, 5 letters: I, J, and 3 lowers).\n\nThen, the probability that J is paired with a lower letter is 3/3 = 1.\n\nMultiply these probabilities:\n\n1/11 * 6/10 * 5/7 * 4/5 * 1 =\n\n(1/11) * (6/10) * (5/7) * (4/5) * 1 =\n\n(1/11) * (6/10) * (4/7) * 1 =\n\n(1/11) * (24/70) =\n\n24/770 =\n\n12/385 ≈ 0.03116.\n\nThis is different from both previous results.\n\nClearly, there's confusion in the approaches. This suggests that the problem is more complex and requires a more careful combinatorial analysis.\n\nAnother approach: Use linearity of expectation. Let's consider the probability that G is in the last pair. For each pair that includes G, compute the probability that this pair is the last one, and sum over all possible pairs containing G.",
    "There are 11 possible pairs containing G: GA, GB, GC, GD, GE, GF, GG (impossible), GH, GI, GJ, GK, GL. Wait, GG is impossible since there's only one G. So 11 pairs.\n\nFor each pair GX (where X is another letter), the probability that GX is the last pair is equal to the probability that GX is the lex greatest pair.\n\nThe total probability is the sum over X > G of the probability that GX is the last pair, plus the sum over X < G of the probability that XG is the last pair.\n\nBut pairs with X < G will be ordered as XG, which starts with X, so these pairs cannot be the last one unless all other pairs start with letters < X, which is impossible since G > X.\n\nTherefore, only pairs where G is paired with X > G (H, I, J, K, L) can potentially be the last pair, forming GH, GI, GJ, GK, GL.\n\nFor each of these pairs GX (X > G), compute the probability that GX is the lex greatest pair.\n\nSum these probabilities to get the total probability that G is in the last pair.\n\nLet's compute this for each X > G:\n\n1. GH: Probability that GH is the last pair.\n\nFor GH to be the last pair, all other pairs must be lex smaller than GH. This requires that:\n\n- H is paired with G.\n\n- All pairs involving letters I, J, K, L must be such that their pairs are lex smaller than GH.\n\nBut pairs involving I, J, K, L can start with I, J, K, or L, which are all higher than G. Therefore, GH cannot be the last pair if any of I, J, K, L are paired with higher letters. Therefore, GH cannot be the last pair.\n\nSimilarly, GI, GJ, GK, GL:\n\nFor GI to be the last pair, all pairs must be lex smaller than GI. But I is higher than G, so pairs starting with I, J, K, L would be higher. Therefore, GI cannot be the last pair.\n\nSimilarly, GJ cannot be the last pair because J is higher than G.\n\nGK cannot be the last pair because K is higher than G.\n\nGL: For GL to be the last pair, all other pairs must be lex smaller than GL. This requires that:\n\n- L is paired with G.\n\n- All pairs involving H, I, J, K must be lex smaller than GL.\n\nPairs involving H, I, J, K can start with H, I, J, K if they are paired with higher letters. However, since L is already paired with G, the highest remaining letter is K.\n\nTo ensure that no pair starts with H, I, J, or K, these letters must be paired with lower letters (A-F).\n\nTherefore, the probability that GL is the last pair is the probability that:\n\n- L is paired with G.\n\n- H, I, J, K are all paired with letters from A-F.\n\nThis is the same scenario we considered earlier. The number of favorable pairings is 360, leading to a probability of 8/231.\n\nTherefore, the total probability that G is in the last pair is 8/231.\n\nTherefore, m = 8, n = 231. They are coprime since 8 and 231 share no common factors (231 = 3*7*11).\n\nThus, m + n = 8 + 231 = 239.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{239}\n"
