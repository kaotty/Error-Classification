      "content": "But maybe another approach is to parametrize the original parabola and then apply the rotation. Alternatively, find the inverse rotation: to find the equation of the rotated parabola, perhaps substitute the inverse rotation into the original equation.\n\nWait, let me think. If we rotate the parabola 60 degrees counterclockwise, then any point (X, Y) on the rotated parabola corresponds to a point (x, y) on the original parabola such that (X, Y) is the rotated version of (x, y). So, to get the equation of the rotated parabola, we can express x and y in terms of X and Y using the inverse rotation.\n\nRotation by θ = 60°, so inverse rotation is θ = -60°, which would be clockwise 60°. The inverse rotation formulas would be:\n\nx = X cos θ + Y sin θ\n\ny = -X sin θ + Y cos θ\n\nBut θ here is 60°, so substituting:\n\nx = X cos 60° + Y sin 60°\n\ny = -X sin 60° + Y cos 60°\n\nThen, substitute x and y into the original equation y = x² - 4.\n\nSo:\n\n-y sin 60° + Y cos 60° = (X cos 60° + Y sin 60°)² - 4\n\nWait, maybe I got confused. Wait, original equation is y = x² - 4. So after rotation, the image parabola's equation is obtained by substituting the inverse rotation into the original equation.\n\nSo, if (X, Y) is a point on the rotated parabola, then the original coordinates (x, y) before rotation would satisfy y = x² - 4. But (X, Y) is obtained by rotating (x, y) by 60°, so:\n\nX = x cos 60° - y sin 60°\n\nY = x sin 60° + y cos 60°\n\nTherefore, to find the equation of the rotated parabola, we need to express x and y in terms of X and Y, then substitute into y = x² - 4.\n\nSo let's solve for x and y in terms of X and Y.\n\nGiven:\n\nX = x cos 60° - y sin 60°\n\nY = x sin 60° + y cos 60°\n\nLet me write cos 60° = 0.5, sin 60° = (√3)/2.\n\nSo,\n\nX = 0.5 x - (√3)/2 y\n\nY = (√3)/2 x + 0.5 y\n\nWe can solve this system of equations for x and y.\n\nLet me write equations:\n\nEquation 1: X = 0.5 x - (√3)/2 y\n\nEquation 2: Y = (√3)/2 x + 0.5 y\n\nLet me solve for x and y.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 2:\n\n2X = x - √3 y --> x = 2X + √3 y\n\nPlug this into equation 2:\n\nY = (√3)/2 (2X + √3 y) + 0.5 y\n\nSimplify:\n\nY = (√3)(X) + (√3 * √3)/2 y + 0.5 y\n\nSimplify √3 * √3 = 3:\n\nY = √3 X + (3/2)y + 0.5 y = √3 X + (3/2 + 1/2)y = √3 X + 2y\n\nTherefore:\n\nY = √3 X + 2y --> solving for y:\n\n2y = Y - √3 X --> y = (Y - √3 X)/2\n\nNow, substitute x = 2X + √3 y into this expression for y:\n\nx = 2X + √3 * [(Y - √3 X)/2] = 2X + (√3 Y - 3 X)/2 = (4X + √3 Y - 3X)/2 = (X + √3 Y)/2\n\nSo now we have x and y in terms of X and Y:\n\nx = (X + √3 Y)/2\n\ny = (Y - √3 X)/2\n\nNow, substitute these into the original equation y = x² - 4:\n\n(Y - √3 X)/2 = [(X + √3 Y)/2]^2 - 4\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominator:\n\nY - √3 X = [(X + √3 Y)^2]/2 - 8\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n2Y - 2√3 X = (X + √3 Y)^2 - 16\n\nNow expand (X + √3 Y)^2:\n\n= X² + 2√3 X Y + 3 Y²\n\nSo:\n\n2Y - 2√3 X = X² + 2√3 X Y + 3 Y² - 16\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n0 = X² + 2√3 X Y + 3 Y² - 16 - 2Y + 2√3 X\n\nSo equation of rotated parabola is:\n\nX² + 2√3 X Y + 3 Y² + 2√3 X - 2Y - 16 = 0",

      "content": "Wait, perhaps better to think that after rotating the original parabola 60 degrees, the image is a new parabola. The intersection points between original and image are points that are fixed under rotation? Not necessarily, unless the rotation is by 0 degrees. But since it's 60 degrees, which is not a multiple of 360, the only fixed point is the origin. But origin is not on the original parabola since y = 0² - 4 = -4 ≠ 0. So intersections are points that were on the original parabola and after rotation are also on the original parabola.\n\nTherefore, if a point (x, y) is on the original parabola, then its rotated image (x', y') is on the rotated parabola. But if (x, y) is also on the rotated parabola, then (x, y) must satisfy both equations: original parabola and rotated parabola.\n\nWait, but rotated parabola is the image of the original parabola under rotation, so (x, y) is on rotated parabola if and only if rotating it -60 degrees (i.e., inverse rotation) gives a point on original parabola.\n\nTherefore, (x, y) is on rotated parabola if and only if when you rotate it -60 degrees, the resulting point (x', y') satisfies y' = x'^2 - 4.\n\nSo, to find intersection points, we need points (x, y) such that:\n\n1. y = x² - 4 (original parabola)\n\n2. When rotated -60 degrees, (x', y') satisfies y' = x'^2 - 4 (i.e., (x, y) is on rotated parabola)\n\nSo combining these two conditions.\n\nSo, let's write equations.\n\nLet me denote the rotation of (x, y) by -60 degrees (i.e., clockwise 60 degrees). The rotation formulas are:\n\nx' = x cos(-60°) - y sin(-60°) = x cos60° + y sin60°\n\ny' = x sin(-60°) + y cos(-60°) = -x sin60° + y cos60°\n\nSo,\n\nx' = 0.5 x + (√3/2) y\n\ny' = - (√3/2) x + 0.5 y\n\nSince (x', y') must lie on original parabola y' = x'^2 - 4.\n\nTherefore,\n\n- (√3/2) x + 0.5 y = (0.5 x + (√3/2) y)^2 - 4\n\nBut also, since (x, y) is on original parabola, y = x² - 4.\n\nTherefore, substitute y = x² - 4 into the above equation.\n\nSo:\n\nLeft side: - (√3/2) x + 0.5 (x² - 4) = - (√3/2) x + 0.5 x² - 2\n\nRight side: [0.5 x + (√3/2)(x² - 4)]² - 4\n\nLet me compute right side:\n\nFirst, compute the term inside the square:\n\n0.5 x + (√3/2)(x² - 4) = (1/2)x + (√3/2)x² - 2√3\n\nFactor out 1/2:\n\n= (1/2)(x) + (1/2)(√3 x² - 4√3)\n\nWait, perhaps better to expand the square:\n\nLet me denote A = 0.5 x + (√3/2)(x² - 4)\n\nSo,\n\nA = (√3/2)x² + (1/2)x - 2√3\n\nThen, A² is:\n\n[(√3/2)x² + (1/2)x - 2√3]^2\n\nThis seems complicated, but let's expand it term by term.\n\nLet me write A = a + b + c, where:\n\na = (√3/2)x²\n\nb = (1/2)x\n\nc = -2√3\n\nThen,\n\nA² = (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc\n\nCompute each term:\n\na² = ( (√3/2)x² )² = (3/4)x⁴\n\nb² = ( (1/2)x )² = (1/4)x²\n\nc² = (-2√3)^2 = 4*3 = 12\n\n2ab = 2*(√3/2 x²)*(1/2 x) = 2*(√3/4 x³) = (√3/2)x³\n\n2ac = 2*(√3/2 x²)*(-2√3) = 2*( - (√3)(2√3)/2 x² ) = 2*( - (3*2)/2 x² ) = 2*(-3x²) = -6x²\n\n2bc = 2*(1/2 x)*(-2√3) = 2*(-√3 x) = -2√3 x\n\nTherefore, combining all terms:\n\nA² = (3/4)x⁴ + (1/4)x² + 12 + (√3/2)x³ -6x² -2√3 x\n\nSimplify:\n\nCombine x² terms: (1/4 - 6)x² = (-23/4)x²\n\nSo:\n\nA² = (3/4)x⁴ + (√3/2)x³ - (23/4)x² - 2√3 x + 12\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nLeft side: - (√3/2) x + 0.5 x² - 2\n\nRight side: A² - 4 = [(3/4)x⁴ + (√3/2)x³ - (23/4)x² - 2√3 x + 12] - 4 = (3/4)x⁴ + (√3/2)x³ - (23/4)x² - 2√3 x + 8\n\nTherefore, equating left and right:\n\n- (√3/2)x + 0.5x² - 2 = (3/4)x⁴ + (√3/2)x³ - (23/4)x² - 2√3 x + 8\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n0 = (3/4)x⁴ + (√3/2)x³ - (23/4)x² - 2√3 x + 8 + (√3/2)x - 0.5x² + 2\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nx⁴ term: 3/4 x⁴\n\nx³ term: (√3/2)x³\n\nx² term: -23/4 x² - 0.5x² = -23/4 - 2/4 = -25/4 x²\n\nx term: -2√3 x + (√3/2)x = (-2√3 + √3/2)x = (-4√3/2 + √3/2)x = (-3√3/2)x\n\nconstant term: 8 + 2 = 10\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n(3/4)x⁴ + (√3/2)x³ - (25/4)x² - (3√3/2)x + 10 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominators:\n\n3x⁴ + 2√3 x³ -25x² -6√3 x +40 =0\n\nSo we have a quartic equation: 3x⁴ + 2√3 x³ -25x² -6√3 x +40 =0\n\nThis seems quite complicated.

Let's try a=3, d=1.\n\nThen,\n\nad=3*1=3, correct.\n\nNow,\n\nae + bd=3e + b*1=3e + b= -2√3\n\nBut coefficients involve √3, so likely b and e involve √3. Let's assume coefficients may involve √3.\n\nLet’s suppose that the quadratic factors have coefficients with √3 terms. Let me denote:\n\nFirst factor: 3t² + pt + q\n\nSecond factor: t² + rt + s\n\nMultiply them:\n\n3t²*t² + (3r + p)t³ + (3s + pr + q)t² + (ps + qr)t + qs=0\n\nCompare with original equation:\n\n3t⁴ -2√3 t³ -25t² +6√3 t +40=0\n\nThus,\n\n3r + p = -2√3\n\n3s + pr + q = -25\n\nps + qr =6√3\n\nqs=40\n\nSo need to find p, q, r, s such that:\n\n1. 3r + p = -2√3\n\n2. 3s + pr + q = -25\n\n3. ps + qr =6√3\n\n4. qs=40\n\nAssume q and s are integers such that qs=40. Possible integer pairs (q,s): (1,40),(2,20),(4,10),(5,8),(8,5),(10,4),(20,2),(40,1), and negatives.\n\nTry q=8, s=5: qs=40.\n\nThen equation 4: qs=8*5=40, correct.\n\nNow equation 3: ps + qr = p*5 +8*r =6√3\n\nEquation 1: 3r + p = -2√3 --> p= -2√3 -3r\n\nSubstitute p into equation 3:\n\n5*(-2√3 -3r) +8r =6√3\n\nSimplify:\n\n-10√3 -15r +8r =6√3\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-10√3 -7r =6√3\n\nMove terms:\n\n-7r =6√3 +10√3=16√3\n\nThus,\n\nr= -16√3 /7\n\nBut r is supposed to be part of the second factor t² + rt + s, which would have coefficients with √3. But s=5 is integer. Maybe possible, but messy. Let's check equation 2:\n\n3s + pr + q =3*5 + p*r +8=15 + p*r +8=23 + p*r= -25\n\nThus,\n\np*r= -25 -23= -48\n\nBut p= -2√3 -3r, so:\n\n(-2√3 -3r)*r= -48\n\nSubstitute r= -16√3 /7:\n\nLeft side:\n\n(-2√3 -3*(-16√3/7))*(-16√3/7)\n\nSimplify inside first:\n\n-2√3 +48√3/7= (-14√3/7 +48√3/7)=34√3/7\n\nMultiply by -16√3/7:\n\n34√3/7 * (-16√3/7)=34*(-16)*(3)/49= (-544*3)/49= -1632/49≈-33.306≠-48\n\nNot matching. So discard this pair.\n\nTry q=5, s=8:\n\nqs=5*8=40.\n\nEquation 3: p*8 +5r=6√3\n\nEquation 1:3r + p= -2√3 --> p= -2√3 -3r\n\nSubstitute into equation3:\n\n8*(-2√3 -3r) +5r=6√3\n\nExpand:\n\n-16√3 -24r +5r=6√3\n\nSimplify:\n\n-16√3 -19r=6√3\n\nThus,\n\n-19r=6√3 +16√3=22√3\n\nr= -22√3 /19\n\nAgain messy. Check equation2:\n\n3s +pr + q=3*8 +p*r +5=24 +p*r +5=29 +p*r= -25 --> p*r= -54\n\nCompute p*r:\n\np= -2√3 -3*(-22√3/19)= -2√3 +66√3/19= (-38√3 +66√3)/19=28√3/19\n\nThus p*r=28√3/19 * (-22√3/19)=28*(-22)*(3)/361= (-616*3)/361≈-5.12≠-54\n\nNope. Not matching.\n\nTry q=10, s=4:\n\nEquation3: p*4 +10r=6√3\n\nEquation1:3r + p= -2√3 --> p= -2√3 -3r\n\nSubstitute into equation3:\n\n4*(-2√3 -3r) +10r=6√3\n\nExpand:\n\n-8√3 -12r +10r=6√3\n\nSimplify:\n\n-8√3 -2r=6√3 --> -2r=14√3 --> r= -7√3\n\nEquation2:3s +pr + q=3*4 +p*r +10=12 +p*r +10=22 +p*r= -25 --> p*r= -47\n\nCompute p*r:\n\np= -2√3 -3*(-7√3)= -2√3 +21√3=19√3\n\nThus p*r=19√3*(-7√3)= -133*3= -399≠-47\n\nNope.\n\nNext pair q= -5, s= -8:\n\nqs=40.\n\nEquation3: p*(-8) + (-5)r=6√3\n\nEquation1:3r + p= -2√3 --> p= -2√3 -3r\n\nSubstitute into equation3:\n\n-8*(-2√3 -3r) -5r=6√3\n\nExpand:\n\n16√3 +24r -5r=6√3\n\nSimplify:\n\n16√3 +19r=6√3 -->19r= -10√3 --> r= -10√3 /19\n\nEquation2:3*(-8) +p*r + (-5)= -24 +p*r -5= -29 +p*r= -25 --> p*r=4\n\nCompute p*r:\n\np= -2√3 -3*(-10√3 /19)= -2√3 +30√3/19= (-38√3 +30√3)/19= (-8√3)/19\n\nThus p*r= (-8√3)/19 * (-10√3)/19=80*3/361=240/361≈0.665≠4\n\nNope.",

The fourth quadrant has x>0, y<0.\n\nSo for each t, compute x=t and y=t² -4. Need x>0 and y<0.\n\nFirst solution:\n\nt= [ -√3 +√123 ]/6\n\nCompute approximate values:\n\n√3≈1.732, √123≈11.090\n\nThus,\n\nt≈(-1.732 +11.090)/6≈9.358/6≈1.559>0\n\nCompute y≈(1.559)^2 -4≈2.43 -4≈-1.57 <0: This is in fourth quadrant.\n\nSecond solution:\n\nt= [ -√3 -√123 ]/6≈(-1.732 -11.090)/6≈-12.822/6≈-2.137<0: x negative, discard.\n\nThird solution:\n\nt= [√3 +√19]/2≈(1.732 +4.358)/2≈6.090/2≈3.045>0\n\nCompute y≈(3.045)^2 -4≈9.27 -4≈5.27>0: y positive, so in first quadrant, discard.\n\nFourth solution:\n\nt= [√3 -√19]/2≈(1.732 -4.358)/2≈(-2.626)/2≈-1.313<0: x negative, discard.\n\nTherefore, only the first solution t= [ -√3 +√123 ]/6 is in fourth quadrant.\n\nThus, the coordinates are:\n\nx= t≈1.559\n\ny= t² -4≈-1.57\n\nBut need exact value.\n\nCompute y-coordinate:\n\ny= t² -4\n\nt= [ -√3 +√123 ]/6\n\nCompute t²:\n\n= [ (-√3 +√123)^2 ]/36\n\n= [3 - 2√3*√123 +123]/36\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [126 - 2√(3*123)]/36\n\nCompute 3*123=369, √369=√(9*41)=3√41\n\nThus,\n\nt²= [126 -2*3√41]/36= [126 -6√41]/36= [21 -√41]/6\n\nTherefore,\n\ny= t² -4= [21 -√41]/6 -4= [21 -√41 -24]/6= [ -3 -√41 ]/6= - (3 +√41)/6\n\nBut the problem states that the y-coordinate is (a -√b)/c. Here we have negative, so maybe -(3 +√41)/6= (-3 -√41)/6= ( -3 -√41 )/6. But the problem says \"the unique point in the fourth quadrant where the original parabola and its image intersect has y-coordinate (a -√b)/c\". However, our result is (-3 -√41)/6. But this can be written as (-3 -√41)/6 = ( - (3 +√41) ) /6. But the problem's form is (a -√b)/c. To match, perhaps we need to factor out the negative sign:\n\nIf we write (-3 -√41)/6 = ( -3 -√41 )/6 = ( - (3 +√41) ) /6. But maybe there's a mistake here.",

Let me double-check.\n\nWhen rotating a point (x, y) counterclockwise by θ degrees, the new coordinates (X, Y) are:\n\nX= x cosθ - y sinθ\n\nY= x sinθ + y cosθ\n\nWhich is what I used. So parametrizing the original parabola as (t, t² -4), then rotating counterclockwise 60 degrees gives:\n\nX= t cos60 - (t² -4) sin60\n\nY= t sin60 + (t² -4) cos60\n\nWhich is correct. Then, the image point (X, Y) must lie on original parabola Y= X² -4.\n\nSo substituting gives the quartic equation. Solving gives t= [ -√3 +√123 ]/6≈1.559, which is in fourth quadrant. Then y-coordinate is - (3 +√41)/6.\n\nBut the problem states the y-coordinate is (a -√b)/c.

But here we have (-3 -√41)/6. Which is equivalent to (-3 -√41)/6= -(3 +√41)/6. But this doesn't match the form given. So perhaps there's an error in the process.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up when solving for u and t.\n\nWait, let's check u substitution:\n\nOriginal equation after substitution: u⁴ -2u³ -25u² +18u +120=0\n\nFactored into (u² +u -10)(u² -3u -12)=0\n\nSolutions u=(-1 ±√41)/2 and u=(3 ±√57)/2\n\nThen u= t√3, so t= u/√3\n\nThus,\n\nFirst solution: u=(-1 +√41)/2 => t=(-1 +√41)/(2√3)= multiply numerator and denominator by √3: (-√3 +√123)/6\n\nSimilarly, √123=√3*√41, so √123=√3*√41\n\nThus, t=(-√3 +√3*√41)/6=√3(√41 -1)/6\n\nThen t²=3(√41 -1)^2/36=3(41 -2√41 +1)/36=3(42 -2√41)/36=(126 -6√41)/36=21/6 -6√41/36=3.5 -√41/6.

    "\n\nOkay, so I need to find the intersection point in the fourth quadrant between the original parabola y = x² - 4 and its image after rotating 60 degrees counterclockwise around the origin. Then, determine the y-coordinate of this point, which is given in the form (a - √b)/c, and find a + b + c where a, b, c are positive integers with a and c being coprime.",
    "First, let me recall how rotation transformations work. Rotating a point (x, y) by θ degrees counterclockwise around the origin results in a new point (x', y') where:\n\nx' = x cos θ - y sin θ\n\ny' = x sin θ + y cos θ\n\nSo, since the original parabola is y = x² - 4, after rotating it 60 degrees, each point (x, y) on the original parabola will be transformed to (x cos 60° - y sin 60°, x sin 60° + y cos 60°). The equation of the rotated parabola can be found by expressing the original equation in terms of the rotated coordinates.",
    "But maybe another approach is to parametrize the original parabola and then apply the rotation. Alternatively, find the inverse rotation: to find the equation of the rotated parabola, perhaps substitute the inverse rotation into the original equation.\n\nWait, let me think. If we rotate the parabola 60 degrees counterclockwise, then any point (X, Y) on the rotated parabola corresponds to a point (x, y) on the original parabola such that (X, Y) is the rotated version of (x, y). So, to get the equation of the rotated parabola, we can express x and y in terms of X and Y using the inverse rotation.\n\nRotation by θ = 60°, so inverse rotation is θ = -60°, which would be clockwise 60°. The inverse rotation formulas would be:\n\nx = X cos θ + Y sin θ\n\ny = -X sin θ + Y cos θ\n\nBut θ here is 60°, so substituting:\n\nx = X cos 60° + Y sin 60°\n\ny = -X sin 60° + Y cos 60°\n\nThen, substitute x and y into the original equation y = x² - 4.\n\nSo:\n\n-y sin 60° + Y cos 60° = (X cos 60° + Y sin 60°)² - 4\n\nWait, maybe I got confused. Wait, original equation is y = x² - 4. So after rotation, the image parabola's equation is obtained by substituting the inverse rotation into the original equation.\n\nSo, if (X, Y) is a point on the rotated parabola, then the original coordinates (x, y) before rotation would satisfy y = x² - 4. But (X, Y) is obtained by rotating (x, y) by 60°, so:\n\nX = x cos 60° - y sin 60°\n\nY = x sin 60° + y cos 60°\n\nTherefore, to find the equation of the rotated parabola, we need to express x and y in terms of X and Y, then substitute into y = x² - 4.\n\nSo let's solve for x and y in terms of X and Y.\n\nGiven:\n\nX = x cos 60° - y sin 60°\n\nY = x sin 60° + y cos 60°\n\nLet me write cos 60° = 0.5, sin 60° = (√3)/2.\n\nSo,\n\nX = 0.5 x - (√3)/2 y\n\nY = (√3)/2 x + 0.5 y\n\nWe can solve this system of equations for x and y.\n\nLet me write equations:\n\nEquation 1: X = 0.5 x - (√3)/2 y\n\nEquation 2: Y = (√3)/2 x + 0.5 y\n\nLet me solve for x and y.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 2:\n\n2X = x - √3 y --> x = 2X + √3 y\n\nPlug this into equation 2:\n\nY = (√3)/2 (2X + √3 y) + 0.5 y\n\nSimplify:\n\nY = (√3)(X) + (√3 * √3)/2 y + 0.5 y\n\nSimplify √3 * √3 = 3:\n\nY = √3 X + (3/2)y + 0.5 y = √3 X + (3/2 + 1/2)y = √3 X + 2y\n\nTherefore:\n\nY = √3 X + 2y --> solving for y:\n\n2y = Y - √3 X --> y = (Y - √3 X)/2\n\nNow, substitute x = 2X + √3 y into this expression for y:\n\nx = 2X + √3 * [(Y - √3 X)/2] = 2X + (√3 Y - 3 X)/2 = (4X + √3 Y - 3X)/2 = (X + √3 Y)/2\n\nSo now we have x and y in terms of X and Y:\n\nx = (X + √3 Y)/2\n\ny = (Y - √3 X)/2\n\nNow, substitute these into the original equation y = x² - 4:\n\n(Y - √3 X)/2 = [(X + √3 Y)/2]^2 - 4\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominator:\n\nY - √3 X = [(X + √3 Y)^2]/2 - 8\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n2Y - 2√3 X = (X + √3 Y)^2 - 16\n\nNow expand (X + √3 Y)^2:\n\n= X² + 2√3 X Y + 3 Y²\n\nSo:\n\n2Y - 2√3 X = X² + 2√3 X Y + 3 Y² - 16\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n0 = X² + 2√3 X Y + 3 Y² - 16 - 2Y + 2√3 X\n\nSo equation of rotated parabola is:\n\nX² + 2√3 X Y + 3 Y² + 2√3 X - 2Y - 16 = 0",
    "But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the rotated parabola's equation is more manageable? Maybe not. Alternatively, since we need to find intersection points between original parabola and rotated parabola, perhaps parametrize the original parabola and plug into the rotated equation? Wait, but original parabola is y = x² - 4. So points on original parabola are (t, t² - 4). Then, rotating these points 60 degrees gives points on the rotated parabola. Wait, but intersections between original and rotated parabola would be points that are on both curves. So such points must satisfy both the original equation and the rotated equation.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps parametrize a point (x, y) that is on both parabolas. So (x, y) is on original parabola: y = x² - 4. And (x, y) is also on the rotated parabola. But how to express the rotated parabola?",
    "Wait, perhaps better to think that after rotating the original parabola 60 degrees, the image is a new parabola. The intersection points between original and image are points that are fixed under rotation? Not necessarily, unless the rotation is by 0 degrees. But since it's 60 degrees, which is not a multiple of 360, the only fixed point is the origin. But origin is not on the original parabola since y = 0² - 4 = -4 ≠ 0. So intersections are points that were on the original parabola and after rotation are also on the original parabola.\n\nTherefore, if a point (x, y) is on the original parabola, then its rotated image (x', y') is on the rotated parabola. But if (x, y) is also on the rotated parabola, then (x, y) must satisfy both equations: original parabola and rotated parabola.\n\nWait, but rotated parabola is the image of the original parabola under rotation, so (x, y) is on rotated parabola if and only if rotating it -60 degrees (i.e., inverse rotation) gives a point on original parabola.\n\nTherefore, (x, y) is on rotated parabola if and only if when you rotate it -60 degrees, the resulting point (x', y') satisfies y' = x'^2 - 4.\n\nSo, to find intersection points, we need points (x, y) such that:\n\n1. y = x² - 4 (original parabola)\n\n2. When rotated -60 degrees, (x', y') satisfies y' = x'^2 - 4 (i.e., (x, y) is on rotated parabola)\n\nSo combining these two conditions.\n\nSo, let's write equations.\n\nLet me denote the rotation of (x, y) by -60 degrees (i.e., clockwise 60 degrees). The rotation formulas are:\n\nx' = x cos(-60°) - y sin(-60°) = x cos60° + y sin60°\n\ny' = x sin(-60°) + y cos(-60°) = -x sin60° + y cos60°\n\nSo,\n\nx' = 0.5 x + (√3/2) y\n\ny' = - (√3/2) x + 0.5 y\n\nSince (x', y') must lie on original parabola y' = x'^2 - 4.\n\nTherefore,\n\n- (√3/2) x + 0.5 y = (0.5 x + (√3/2) y)^2 - 4\n\nBut also, since (x, y) is on original parabola, y = x² - 4.\n\nTherefore, substitute y = x² - 4 into the above equation.\n\nSo:\n\nLeft side: - (√3/2) x + 0.5 (x² - 4) = - (√3/2) x + 0.5 x² - 2\n\nRight side: [0.5 x + (√3/2)(x² - 4)]² - 4\n\nLet me compute right side:\n\nFirst, compute the term inside the square:\n\n0.5 x + (√3/2)(x² - 4) = (1/2)x + (√3/2)x² - 2√3\n\nFactor out 1/2:\n\n= (1/2)(x) + (1/2)(√3 x² - 4√3)\n\nWait, perhaps better to expand the square:\n\nLet me denote A = 0.5 x + (√3/2)(x² - 4)\n\nSo,\n\nA = (√3/2)x² + (1/2)x - 2√3\n\nThen, A² is:\n\n[(√3/2)x² + (1/2)x - 2√3]^2\n\nThis seems complicated, but let's expand it term by term.\n\nLet me write A = a + b + c, where:\n\na = (√3/2)x²\n\nb = (1/2)x\n\nc = -2√3\n\nThen,\n\nA² = (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc\n\nCompute each term:\n\na² = ( (√3/2)x² )² = (3/4)x⁴\n\nb² = ( (1/2)x )² = (1/4)x²\n\nc² = (-2√3)^2 = 4*3 = 12\n\n2ab = 2*(√3/2 x²)*(1/2 x) = 2*(√3/4 x³) = (√3/2)x³\n\n2ac = 2*(√3/2 x²)*(-2√3) = 2*( - (√3)(2√3)/2 x² ) = 2*( - (3*2)/2 x² ) = 2*(-3x²) = -6x²\n\n2bc = 2*(1/2 x)*(-2√3) = 2*(-√3 x) = -2√3 x\n\nTherefore, combining all terms:\n\nA² = (3/4)x⁴ + (1/4)x² + 12 + (√3/2)x³ -6x² -2√3 x\n\nSimplify:\n\nCombine x² terms: (1/4 - 6)x² = (-23/4)x²\n\nSo:\n\nA² = (3/4)x⁴ + (√3/2)x³ - (23/4)x² - 2√3 x + 12\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nLeft side: - (√3/2) x + 0.5 x² - 2\n\nRight side: A² - 4 = [(3/4)x⁴ + (√3/2)x³ - (23/4)x² - 2√3 x + 12] - 4 = (3/4)x⁴ + (√3/2)x³ - (23/4)x² - 2√3 x + 8\n\nTherefore, equating left and right:\n\n- (√3/2)x + 0.5x² - 2 = (3/4)x⁴ + (√3/2)x³ - (23/4)x² - 2√3 x + 8\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n0 = (3/4)x⁴ + (√3/2)x³ - (23/4)x² - 2√3 x + 8 + (√3/2)x - 0.5x² + 2\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nx⁴ term: 3/4 x⁴\n\nx³ term: (√3/2)x³\n\nx² term: -23/4 x² - 0.5x² = -23/4 - 2/4 = -25/4 x²\n\nx term: -2√3 x + (√3/2)x = (-2√3 + √3/2)x = (-4√3/2 + √3/2)x = (-3√3/2)x\n\nconstant term: 8 + 2 = 10\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n(3/4)x⁴ + (√3/2)x³ - (25/4)x² - (3√3/2)x + 10 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominators:\n\n3x⁴ + 2√3 x³ -25x² -6√3 x +40 =0\n\nSo we have a quartic equation: 3x⁴ + 2√3 x³ -25x² -6√3 x +40 =0\n\nThis seems quite complicated. Maybe factorizing?",
    "Alternatively, perhaps notice that the original parabola and its rotated image might intersect at points symmetric in some way? But since it's rotated 60 degrees, symmetry might not help.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps substitute x = t and try to solve for t. But quartic equations are difficult. Maybe there's a quadratic factor?",
    "Alternatively, perhaps consider that the intersection points include the original points that are invariant under rotation by 60 degrees. But since rotation by 60 degrees is not trivial, except origin, but origin isn't on the parabola. So maybe not.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps note that the original parabola and rotated parabola intersect in the fourth quadrant, so x >0, y <0. Maybe try to parametrize the original parabola as x = t, y = t² -4, then apply rotation and set the rotated point (x', y') to lie on the original parabola y = x² -4. Then solve for t.\n\nWait, that might be a better approach.\n\nLet me try this.\n\nParametrize original parabola as (t, t² -4). Rotate this point by 60 degrees counterclockwise. The image point is:\n\nx' = t cos60° - (t² -4) sin60°\n\ny' = t sin60° + (t² -4) cos60°\n\nSo,\n\nx' = 0.5 t - (√3/2)(t² -4)\n\ny' = (√3/2) t + 0.5(t² -4)\n\nSince this image point lies on the original parabola y = x² -4, so:\n\ny' = (x')² -4\n\nTherefore,\n\n(√3/2) t + 0.5(t² -4) = [0.5 t - (√3/2)(t² -4)]² -4\n\nLet me compute right side:\n\nFirst, compute the term inside the square:\n\n0.5 t - (√3/2)(t² -4) = (1/2)t - (√3/2)t² + 2√3\n\nLet me denote this as A = (1/2)t - (√3/2)t² + 2√3\n\nThen, A² = [ (1/2)t - (√3/2)t² + 2√3 ]²\n\nAgain, expanding this:\n\nA² = [ - (√3/2)t² + (1/2)t + 2√3 ]²\n\nLet me expand term by term:\n\nLet me write A = a + b + c, where:\n\na = - (√3/2)t²\n\nb = (1/2)t\n\nc = 2√3\n\nThen,\n\nA² = a² + b² + c² + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc\n\nCompute each term:\n\na² = ( (√3/2)t² )² = (3/4)t⁴\n\nWait, but a is negative: a = - (√3/2)t², so a² = (3/4)t⁴\n\nb² = ( (1/2)t )² = (1/4)t²\n\nc² = (2√3)^2 = 4*3=12\n\n2ab = 2*(-√3/2 t²)(1/2 t) = 2*(-√3/4 t³) = - (√3/2) t³\n\n2ac = 2*(-√3/2 t²)(2√3) = 2*(- (√3)(2√3)/2 t² ) = 2*(- (3*2)/2 t² ) = 2*(-3 t²) = -6 t²\n\n2bc = 2*(1/2 t)(2√3) = 2*(√3 t) = 2√3 t\n\nTherefore, combining all terms:\n\nA² = (3/4)t⁴ + (1/4)t² +12 - (√3/2)t³ -6 t² +2√3 t\n\nSimplify:\n\nCombine t² terms: (1/4 -6)t² = (-23/4)t²\n\nSo,\n\nA² = (3/4)t⁴ - (√3/2)t³ - (23/4)t² +2√3 t +12\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nLeft side: (√3/2)t + 0.5 t² - 2\n\nRight side: A² -4 = (3/4)t⁴ - (√3/2)t³ - (23/4)t² +2√3 t +12 -4 = (3/4)t⁴ - (√3/2)t³ - (23/4)t² +2√3 t +8\n\nSet left side equal to right side:\n\n(√3/2)t + 0.5 t² - 2 = (3/4)t⁴ - (√3/2)t³ - (23/4)t² +2√3 t +8\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n0 = (3/4)t⁴ - (√3/2)t³ - (23/4)t² +2√3 t +8 - (√3/2)t -0.5 t² +2\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nt⁴: 3/4 t⁴\n\nt³: -√3/2 t³\n\nt²: -23/4 t² -0.5 t² = -23/4 -2/4 = -25/4 t²\n\nt terms: 2√3 t - √3/2 t = (4√3/2 - √3/2)t = (3√3/2)t\n\nconstants: 8 +2 =10\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n(3/4)t⁴ - (√3/2)t³ - (25/4)t² + (3√3/2)t +10 =0\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominators:\n\n3t⁴ - 2√3 t³ -25t² +6√3 t +40=0\n\nSame quartic equation as before: 3t⁴ -2√3 t³ -25t² +6√3 t +40=0\n\nSo, same equation. So this seems unavoidable. Now, need to solve this quartic equation.\n\nQuartic equations can be tough, but maybe it factors into quadratics or has rational roots?\n\nFirst, check for rational roots using Rational Root Theorem.

    "Wait, let's check computations again.\n\nCompute t= [ -√3 +√123 ]/6\n\nWait, √123=√(3*41)=√3*√41, so √123=√3*√41.\n\nTherefore, t= [ -√3 +√3*√41 ]/6= [√3(-1 +√41)]/6= √3(√41 -1)/6\n\nThen t²= [3(√41 -1)^2]/36= [3(41 -2√41 +1)]/36= [3(42 -2√41)]/36= [126 -6√41]/36= [21 -√41]/6\n\nThus, y= t² -4= [21 -√41]/6 -4= [21 -√41 -24]/6= [ -3 -√41 ]/6= - (3 +√41)/6\n\nBut the problem states the y-coordinate is (a -√b)/c.

So this suggests there's a mistake.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the rotation direction?",
    "Wait, the problem says rotating counterclockwise 60 degrees. Did I do clockwise?\n\nWait, when I derived the rotated coordinates, I used rotation formulas. Let me double-check.\n\nWhen rotating a point (x, y) counterclockwise by θ degrees, the new coordinates (X, Y) are:\n\nX= x cosθ - y sinθ\n\nY= x sinθ + y cosθ\n\nWhich is what I used. So parametrizing the original parabola as (t, t² -4), then rotating counterclockwise 60 degrees gives:\n\nX= t cos60 - (t² -4) sin60\n\nY= t sin60 + (t² -4) cos60\n\nWhich is correct. Then, the image point (X, Y) must lie on original parabola Y= X² -4.\n\nSo substituting gives the quartic equation. Solving gives t= [ -√3 +√123 ]/6≈1.559, which is in fourth quadrant. Then y-coordinate is - (3 +√41)/6.\n\nBut the problem states the y-coordinate is (a -√b)/c. So unless there's a mistake in sign.\n\nWait, perhaps during substitution, I made a mistake in expanding terms. Let me check:\n\nWe had y= t² -4= [21 -√41]/6 -4= [21 -√41 -24]/6= [ -3 -√41 ]/6\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut according to problem statement, the answer should be (a -√b)/c with a, b, c positive integers. But here we have (-3 -√41)/6. Which is equivalent to (-3 -√41)/6= -(3 +√41)/6. But this doesn't match the form given. So perhaps there's an error in the process.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up when solving for u and t.\n\nWait, let's check u substitution:\n\nOriginal equation after substitution: u⁴ -2u³ -25u² +18u +120=0\n\nFactored into (u² +u -10)(u² -3u -12)=0\n\nSolutions u=(-1 ±√41)/2 and u=(3 ±√57)/2\n\nThen u= t√3, so t= u/√3\n\nThus,\n\nFirst solution: u=(-1 +√41)/2 => t=(-1 +√41)/(2√3)= multiply numerator and denominator by √3: (-√3 +√123)/6\n\nSimilarly, √123=√3*√41, so √123=√3*√41\n\nThus, t=(-√3 +√3*√41)/6=√3(√41 -1)/6\n\nThen t²=3(√41 -1)^2/36=3(41 -2√41 +1)/36=3(42 -2√41)/36=(126 -6√41)/36=21/6 -6√41/36=3.5 -√41/6. Wait, but earlier computation said [21 -√41]/6. Wait, 126 -6√41 divided by 36 is (126/36) - (6√41)/36=3.5 - (√41)/6=7/2 - √41/6= (21 -√41)/6. Yes, correct.\n\nThus, t²=(21 -√41)/6\n\nTherefore, y= t² -4=(21 -√41)/6 -24/6=(21 -24 -√41)/6=(-3 -√41)/6\n\nSo indeed, y= (-3 -√41)/6. But problem says it's (a -√b)/c.

    "Wait, maybe the rotation was clockwise instead of counterclockwise? The problem says counterclockwise. So that shouldn't be the issue.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the intersection point is different.",
    "Wait, but we found only one intersection point in fourth quadrant. Maybe there's another?\n\nWait, when solving quartic equation, we had four roots. Two gave x negative, one gave x positive with y positive (first quadrant), and one gave x positive with y negative (fourth quadrant). So that's the unique point in fourth quadrant.\n\nThus, unless there's a calculation mistake, the y-coordinate is (-3 -√41)/6. But the problem says it's (a -√b)/c. So unless they consider a negative a? But a must be positive. So perhaps there's a mistake in my process.\n\nWait, let's check again the rotation.\n\nOriginal parabola: y=x² -4.\n\nRotated 60 degrees counterclockwise around the origin.\n\nParametrizing original parabola as (t, t² -4). Rotate this point 60 degrees counterclockwise:\n\nX= t cos60 - (t² -4) sin60=0.5 t - (√3/2)(t² -4)\n\nY= t sin60 + (t² -4) cos60=(√3/2)t +0.5(t² -4)\n\nThen, image point (X,Y) must lie on original parabola: Y= X² -4.\n\nThus:\n\n(√3/2)t +0.5(t² -4)=[0.5 t - (√3/2)(t² -4)]² -4\n\nExpand right side:\n\nFirst compute inside the square:\n\n0.5 t - (√3/2)(t² -4)=0.5 t - (√3/2)t² + 2√3\n\nSquare this:\n\nA²= [0.5 t - (√3/2)t² + 2√3]^2\n\nAs done earlier, expanded to:\n\n(3/4)t⁴ - (√3/2)t³ - (23/4)t² +2√3 t +12\n\nThus, equation:\n\n(√3/2)t +0.5 t² -2= (3/4)t⁴ - (√3/2)t³ - (23/4)t² +2√3 t +8\n\nBringing all terms to left:\n\n0=3/4 t⁴ -√3/2 t³ -25/4 t² + 3√3/2 t +10\n\nMultiply by4:\n\n3t⁴ -2√3 t³ -25t² +6√3 t +40=0\n\nWhich factors into:\n\n(√3 t² + t -10)(√3 t² -3t -12)=0\n\nWait, no. Wait, earlier substitution led to factoring in terms of u. Wait, no, the factors were (u² +u -10)(u² -3u -12)=0 where u= t√3.\n\nThus, substituting back:\n\n(u² +u -10)=0 --> t√3)^2 + t√3 -10=0 -->3t² +√3 t -10=0\n\nSimilarly, u² -3u -12=0 --> (t√3)^2 -3 t√3 -12=0 -->3t² -3√3 t -12=0\n\nThus, the factors are:\n\n3t² +√3 t -10=0 and 3t² -3√3 t -12=0\n\nSolving first equation:\n\n3t² +√3 t -10=0\n\nt= [ -√3 ±√(3 +120) ]/(2*3)= [ -√3 ±√123 ]/6\n\nSecond equation:\n\n3t² -3√3 t -12=0\n\nDivide by3:\n\nt² -√3 t -4=0\n\nt= [√3 ±√(3 +16) ]/2= [√3 ±√19]/2\n\nThus, solutions:\n\nt= [ -√3 ±√123 ]/6 and t= [√3 ±√19 ]/2\n\nSame as before.\n\nThus, same results.

Let's denote this point as (h, k), where h>0, k<0.\n\nThis point lies on the original parabola: k =h² -4.\n\nAfter rotating (h, k) 60 degrees counterclockwise, the new coordinates (H, K) must also lie on the original parabola: K =H² -4.\n\nBut (H, K) is the rotated image of (h, k):\n\nH= h cos60 -k sin60=0.5h - (√3/2)k\n\nK= h sin60 +k cos60=(√3/2)h +0.5k\n\nThus, K=H² -4.\n\nSubstitute K and H:\n\n(√3/2 h +0.5k)= (0.5h - (√3/2 k))² -4\n\nBut k= h² -4, substitute:\n\n(√3/2 h +0.5(h² -4))= (0.5h - (√3/2)(h² -4))² -4\n\nThis is the same equation as before, leading to quartic equation.\n\nThus, no way around solving the quartic equation.\n\nGiven that this is a math competition problem, likely the quartic equation can be factored into two quadratics with √3 terms.\n\nLet me attempt to factor the quartic equation 3x⁴ -2√3 x³ -25x² +6√3 x +40=0\n\nAssume factors are (ax² +bx +c)(dx² +ex +f)=0\n\nMultiply out:\n\nad x⁴ + (ae + bd)x³ + (af + be + cd)x² + (bf + ce)x + cf=0\n\nCompare with 3x⁴ -2√3 x³ -25x² +6√3 x +40=0\n\nThus:\n\nad=3\n\nae + bd= -2√3\n\naf + be + cd= -25\n\nbf + ce=6√3\n\ncf=40\n\nAssume a and d are integers.
