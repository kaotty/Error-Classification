If I is paired with K, it's IK. So, pairs starting with I would be IJ, IK. Similarly, J paired with K is JK.\n\nTherefore, in the remaining letters (A-F, H, I, J, K), the pairs starting with H, I, J, K are HI, HJ, HK, IJ, IK, JK. All other pairs would start with A-F.\n\nTherefore, for there to be no pairs starting with H, I, J, K, we must pair all H, I, J, K with letters from A-F.

Then, the remaining 2 letters from A-F are paired together, and the remaining 0 letters from H, I, J, K (since all are paired). Wait, but H, I, J, K are 4 letters, and we pair each with a distinct letter from A-F (which has 6). So, we need to choose 4 distinct letters from A-F and pair them with H, I, J, K. The number of ways is P(6, 4) = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3. Then, the remaining 2 letters from A-F can be paired in 1 way (since order doesn't matter). Wait, but pairings are unordered. So, actually, the number of ways is:\n\nFirst, choose 4 letters from A-F: C(6, 4).\n\nThen, assign each of H, I, J, K to one of these 4 letters: 4! ways.\n\nThen, pair the remaining 2 letters from A-F: 1 way.\n\nBut actually, in terms of perfect matchings, the total number of ways to pair the remaining 10 letters is (10)! / (2^5 5!). However, the number of favorable pairings where H, I, J, K are all paired with A-F is:\n\nFirst, pair H, I, J, K with 4 distinct letters from A-F.

Since pairings are unordered, we need to divide by the number of orderings of the pairs. But since we are counting distinct pairings, actually, this product (6*5*4*3*1) is equal to 6*5*4*3 = 360.

Each of these pairs, when formed, has a certain probability of being the maximum pair, which we calculated as 8/21 for each, given that G is paired with that specific letter.\n\nTherefore, total probability is 5*(1/11)*(8/21) = 40/231 ≈ 0.173, which is approximately 17.3%.\n\nBut let me verify this with a smaller case to see if the approach holds.\n\nSuppose we have only 4 letters: A, B, C, D. We want the probability that the last word contains B.\n\nPossible pairings:\n\nPossible pairings are:\n\n1. AB, CD\n\n2. AC, BD\n\n3. AD, BC\n\n4. BC, AD\n\n5. BD, AC\n\n6. CD, AB\n\nWait, but actually, the number of pairings is 3 for 4 letters. Wait, no: for 4 letters, the number of pairings is 3. For example:\n\n1. (AB, CD)\n\n2. (AC, BD)\n\n3. (AD, BC)\n\nEach of these has two pairs. Then, ordered alphabetically:\n\nFor pairing 1: AB, CD. Sorted: AB, CD. Last word is CD, which contains D.\n\nPairing 2: AC, BD. Sorted: AC, BD. Last word is BD, contains B.\n\nPairing 3: AD, BC. Sorted: AD, BC. Last word is BC, contains B.\n\nSo, out of 3 possible pairings, in two of them the last word contains B. Therefore, probability is 2/3.\n\nUsing our formula:\n\nLetters are A, B, C, D. We want the probability that the last word contains B.\n\nPossible pairs involving B: BA, BC, BD. Ordered as AB, BC, BD.\n\nThe maximum pair can be CD, BD, BC, or AD, etc.\n\nBut according to our previous approach:\n\nFor B to be in the last pair, B must be paired with C or D.\n\nIf B is paired with C: BC. For BC to be the maximum pair, there must be no pairs starting with C or D. The remaining letters are A and D. Pairing A and D gives AD, which starts with A. Therefore, BC would be the maximum pair. So, if B is paired with C, probability BC is maximum is 1.\n\nSimilarly, if B is paired with D: BD. Remaining letters are A and C. Pair AC or CA, which is AC. So, BD is greater than AC. Therefore, BD is the maximum pair.\n\nIf B is paired with A: AB. Remaining pairs are CD or others. CD is greater than AB. Therefore, AB is not the maximum.\n\nTherefore, when B is paired with C or D (probability 2/3), the pair is maximum. Therefore, probability is 2/3, which matches the actual count.\n\nUsing our formula:\n\nNumber of possible partners after B: C, D (2 letters).\n\nFor each partner, probability B pairs with them is 1/3 (since 3 partners: A, C, D).\n\nGiven pairing with C, probability BC is maximum: remaining letters A and D must be paired as AD. So, number of favorable pairings: 1 (AD). Total pairings: 1 (since only one way to pair A and D). Therefore, probability 1/1 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, pairing B with D: remaining letters A and C can only pair as AC. Probability BD is maximum: 1.\n\nTherefore, total probability: (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*1 = 2/3.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nIn this case, our formula works. So, extending this to the original problem, the approach seems valid.\n\nTherefore, returning to the original problem, the answer should be 40/231, so m + n = 271.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{271}\n",

    "\n\nOkay, so I have this problem where there are twelve letters: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, and L. They are randomly grouped into six pairs. Then, in each pair, the letters are arranged alphabetically to form two-letter words. These six words are then listed alphabetically. The question is asking for the probability that the last word in this alphabetical list contains the letter G. The answer needs to be expressed as a reduced fraction m/n and then find m + n.",
    "First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have twelve distinct letters, each paired with another randomly. Each pair is ordered alphabetically, so for example, if a pair is (G, D), it becomes DG. Then, all six words are sorted alphabetically into a list, and we need the probability that the last word in this sorted list includes the letter G.\n\nSo, steps involved:\n\n1. Pairing the 12 letters randomly into six pairs.\n2. Ordering each pair alphabetically to form words.\n3. Sorting these six words alphabetically.\n4. Determining the probability that the last word in this sorted list contains G.\n\nTo approach this, maybe I can think about the position of G in the sorted list. Since the list is alphabetical, the last word would be the one that comes last in the alphabetical order. Therefore, the last word is the lexicographically greatest word among the six.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: What is the probability that when pairing the 12 letters, G is paired with a letter such that their pair, when ordered alphabetically, is the lexicographically greatest among all six pairs.",
    "Alternatively, maybe not exactly, because even if G is in a pair that's not the greatest, perhaps the actual greatest pair doesn't exist? Wait, no. All pairs are ordered alphabetically, so each pair is a two-letter word in alphabetical order. Then, when sorted, the last word is the lex greatest of all six words. So, the question is: What is the probability that G is in the pair that forms the lex greatest word.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is equivalent to: What's the probability that G is paired with a letter that, when ordered with G, forms the lex greatest word among all possible pairs.",
    "But wait, lex greatest word would be the pair where the second letter is latest in the alphabet. Since all pairs are ordered alphabetically, the first letter is earlier than the second. So, the lex order of the words is determined first by the first letter, then by the second. So, for example, AB comes before AC, which comes before AD, etc., and BA would actually be written as AB. Wait, no—since the pairs are ordered alphabetically, BA would become AB. So, all pairs are in alphabetical order. Therefore, the words are all ascending.\n\nTherefore, the lex order of the list is determined first by the first letter, then the second. So, the last word in the list would be the one with the lex greatest first letter, and among those, the lex greatest second letter.",
    "Wait, but since all pairs are ordered alphabetically, the first letter is always the earlier one. So, the lex order of the entire list is first sorted by the first letter, then by the second. Therefore, the last word would be the one with the highest first letter, and among those, the highest second letter.",
    "But since the first letters can't be higher than L, but L is the last letter. Wait, letters go up to L. So, the highest possible first letter is L, but since all pairs are ordered alphabetically, the first letter can't be L unless paired with a letter after L, but there is no letter after L. So, actually, the highest possible first letter is K, since K can be paired with L, making KL. Wait, but KL would be ordered as KL since K comes before L. So, KL is a possible word.\n\nWait, but L can't be a first letter unless paired with a letter that comes after L, which doesn't exist. Therefore, the highest possible first letter is K, and the highest possible word is KL. Then, if KL is one of the pairs, it would be the last word. If KL is not a pair, then the next highest would be something like KJ, KK (but we don't have duplicate letters), so KJ would be next. Wait, but KK isn't possible. Wait, all letters are distinct.\n\nTherefore, the lex greatest word is determined first by the highest possible first letter, which is K, then the highest possible second letter given that first letter. Since K is the highest first letter possible (as L cannot be a first letter), then KL is the highest possible word. If KL is present, it will be last. If not, then the next highest would be KJ, then KI, etc.\n\nSimilarly, if K is paired with someone lower than L, then KL isn't formed, but KJ might be, but KJ would come before KL. Wait, no. If K is paired with J, then the word is JK. Wait, no—wait, pairs are ordered alphabetically. So, if K is paired with J, since J comes before K, the word is JK. Similarly, if K is paired with L, since K comes before L, the word is KL. So, KL is higher than JK. Wait, no. Wait, JK is J followed by K, KL is K followed by L. Since J comes before K, JK would come before KL in the alphabetical list. Therefore, KL is higher than JK because K is the first letter.",
    "Therefore, the lex order of the entire list is determined first by the first letter. So, words starting with A come first, then B, ..., up to K. Then, within the same first letter, words are ordered by the second letter. So, KL would be the last word if it exists. If KL is not formed, then the next possible word starting with K would be KJ, KI, etc., but KJ would actually be JK when ordered alphabetically. Wait, hold on—this is a crucial point.",
    "Wait, if K is paired with J, since J comes before K, the pair is ordered as JK. Similarly, if K is paired with I, it's IK. Wait, no—if K is paired with I, since I comes before K, the pair is IK. Therefore, the first letter is always the earlier one in the alphabet. Therefore, K can only be the first letter if it's paired with a letter that comes after K, which is L. So, the only word starting with K is KL. All other pairs involving K would have K as the second letter, with the first letter being A to J.\n\nTherefore, KL is the only word starting with K. If KL is formed, then KL is the last word in the list. If KL is not formed, then we look for the highest first letter among the remaining pairs, which would be J. Then, the highest word starting with J would be the one with the highest second letter. The highest possible second letter after J is L, because J can pair with K or L, but J paired with K is JK, and J paired with L is JL. So, JL would be higher than JK. Therefore, if there's a pair starting with J, JL would be higher than JK.",
    "Wait, but again, J paired with L would be JL, but if J is paired with K, it's JK. So, if KL is not formed, then the highest possible word would be JL if it exists, otherwise JK, etc.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe instead of considering all possibilities, there's a smarter way. Since the problem is about the probability that G is in the last word, which is the lex greatest word.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the key is to determine the probability that G is paired with a letter such that their pair is the lex greatest among all pairs.\n\nBut how do we compute that?",
    "Alternatively, maybe we can think of all possible pairings and determine in how many of them G is in the pair that becomes the last word.\n\nBut since pairings are random, maybe we can fix G and compute the probability that G's pair is the lex greatest.",
    "Wait, but G is a specific letter. The lex greatest pair is KL if it exists. Otherwise, it's the next possible. Therefore, if KL is present, then KL is the last word, so G is not in KL unless G is K or L. But G is a specific letter here—G is the 7th letter (A=1, B=2, ..., G=7, ..., L=12). So, G is fixed. Therefore, KL is a pair that doesn't involve G. Therefore, if KL is formed, then the last word is KL, which doesn't contain G. Therefore, in order for G to be in the last word, KL must not be formed, and the next lex greatest word must contain G.",
    "Wait, this seems complicated. Let me try to formalize this.",
    "First, note that the lex greatest word is the pair with the highest first letter, and then the highest second letter. Since all pairs are ordered alphabetically, the first letter is the earlier one. Therefore, the lex greatest word is the pair with the highest possible first letter, and then the highest possible second letter given that first letter.\n\nGiven that, the highest possible first letter is K (since K can pair with L to form KL). If KL is formed, then KL is the last word, and G is not in KL. Therefore, in order for G to be in the last word, KL must not be formed. Then, the next highest possible first letter is J. The highest word starting with J would be JL (if J is paired with L), otherwise JK (if J is paired with K), etc. Similarly, if J is paired with a lower letter, then the highest second letter possible.\n\nBut G is a specific letter. So, for G to be in the last word, either:\n\n1. G is paired with L, forming GL, which would be ordered as GL. Then, GL would be the last word if there are no pairs with a higher first letter than G. But G is the 7th letter. Letters after G are H, I, J, K, L. So, if any of those letters (H to L) are paired with letters after them, forming pairs starting with H, I, J, K, then those pairs would come after GL.\n\nAlternatively, if G is paired with a letter higher than G, say H, I, J, K, or L. Then, the pair would be ordered as G followed by the higher letter. For example, pairing G with H gives GH, pairing G with L gives GL. Then, the word GL would be higher than GH, GI, GJ, GK, GL.\n\nBut GL's position in the overall list depends on whether there are pairs starting with letters higher than G. For example, if there's a pair starting with H, I, J, K, then those would come after GL. Therefore, GL can only be the last word if there are no pairs starting with H, I, J, K, or L (but L cannot start a pair unless paired with someone after L, which doesn't exist). Wait, but pairs starting with K would only be KL. Similarly, pairs starting with J would be JL or JK, etc.",
    "Wait, this seems too involved. Maybe there's a better approach.",
    "Alternatively, think of all possible pairs that can be the last word. The last word is the lex greatest, so it must be the pair with the highest possible first letter, and then the highest possible second letter.\n\nSo, the possible last words, in order of precedence, are:\n\n1. KL (if present)\n2. If KL is not present, then the next possible last word would be the highest possible pair starting with K. But since K can only pair with L to start with K, if KL isn't present, K must be paired with someone earlier, so the pair would be something like KA, KB, ..., KJ, but ordered as AK, BK, ..., JK. Therefore, those pairs start with A, B, ..., J. Therefore, if KL is not formed, then the highest first letter among the remaining pairs would be J. Then, the highest pair starting with J would be JL (if present), otherwise JK, etc.\n\nSimilarly, if JL is present, then JL is the last word. If not, then the highest pair starting with J would be JK, etc.\n\nThis recursive process seems complicated. Maybe instead, consider that the probability that G is in the last word is equal to the probability that G is paired with the \"maximum remaining letter\" at the stage when G is paired.\n\nWait, perhaps using linearity of expectation or something else.",
    "Alternatively, think of all possible letters that G can pair with. There are 11 possible partners for G. For each possible partner, determine the probability that pairing G with that partner results in their pair being the last word.\n\nThen sum over all partners the probability that G pairs with that partner and that their pair is the last word.\n\nBut how to compute that?",
    "Alternatively, the probability that G is in the last pair is equal to the probability that G is paired with the letter that, when paired with G, forms the lex greatest word. But lex greatest word depends on all other pairings.\n\nWait, maybe inclusion in the maximum. In probability, the probability that a particular element is the maximum in a random set can sometimes be computed as 1/n, but this is different because the pairings affect what the maximum is.",
    "Wait, perhaps consider that each pair is a possible candidate for the maximum word. The total number of pairs is six. Each pair has some chance to be the maximum. The probability that a particular pair is the maximum is equal to the probability that all other pairs are lex smaller.\n\nBut since the pairings are random, maybe we can model this as follows:",
    "First, list all possible pairs. Each pair is a combination of two letters, ordered alphabetically. The total number of possible pairs is C(12, 2) = 66. But the pairing is a perfect matching: dividing the 12 letters into six disjoint pairs.\n\nThe problem is equivalent to: In a random perfect matching of the 12 letters, what is the probability that the pair containing G is the lex greatest pair (i.e., the pair that, when ordered, is the lex greatest among all six pairs).\n\nIf that's the case, then the probability we need is the probability that, among all six pairs, the pair containing G is the lex greatest.\n\nSo, how to compute that?\n\nThe lex greatest pair is the pair with the highest possible first letter, and then the highest possible second letter.\n\nSo, first, check if there is a pair starting with K. The only pair starting with K is KL. If KL exists, then KL is the lex greatest pair. If not, then check for pairs starting with J. The highest pair starting with J would be JL, then JK, etc.\n\nTherefore, the lex greatest pair is determined by sequentially checking for the highest possible first letter and then the highest possible second letter.\n\nTherefore, the lex greatest pair is KL if it exists; otherwise, it's JL if it exists; otherwise, it's JK if it exists; otherwise, it's IL if it exists, etc., down to lower letters.\n\nTherefore, the presence of higher pairs affects whether lower pairs can be the maximum.\n\nBut since we need the probability that G is in the maximum pair, regardless of what that pair is.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps we can think recursively.\n\nSuppose we consider all possible pairings and determine in each case whether G is in the maximum pair.",
    "Alternatively, note that for G to be in the maximum pair, G must be paired with a letter such that their pair is greater than all other pairs.\n\nBut pairs are formed such that all other letters are also paired. Therefore, the maximum pair is the pair that is lex greatest, which could be KL, JL, JK, IL, etc., depending on pairings.",
    "Alternatively, think of the problem as follows: The lex greatest pair is the pair containing the highest letter possible as the second element, given the first element.",
    "But maybe another approach: Consider the letters in order from highest to lowest: L, K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A.\n\nWe need to find the probability that G is part of the pair that is lex greatest.",
    "The lex greatest pair is determined by the first letter (as early as possible) and then the second letter. Wait, no—lex order is determined first by the first letter, then the second. So, the pair with the highest first letter is the greatest, and if two pairs have the same first letter, the one with the higher second letter is greater.\n\nGiven that, the maximum pair is the one with the highest first letter possible, and among those, the highest second letter.\n\nTherefore, the maximum pair is KL if it exists. If not, then the maximum pair is the next possible pair starting with K, but since K can only start a pair if paired with L (since all other letters are before K), and if K is not paired with L, then K is the second element in some pair, which would start with a letter before K.\n\nTherefore, if KL is not formed, then the maximum pair would be the pair starting with J, with the highest possible second letter. The highest possible pair starting with J is JL. Similarly, if JL is not formed, then JK, etc.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe instead, think of the problem as a competition among all possible pairs for being the maximum. Each pair has a certain chance to be the maximum, and we need the probability that the pair containing G is the maximum.",
    "Alternatively, note that the maximum pair is unique. Therefore, the probability that G is in the maximum pair is equal to the sum over all possible pairs containing G of the probability that that pair is the maximum pair.\n\nSo, if we can compute for each possible pair (G, X), the probability that (G, X) is the maximum pair, then sum those probabilities.\n\nBut how to compute the probability that a specific pair (G, X) is the maximum pair?\n\nFor example, take the pair (G, L). When ordered, this becomes GL. For GL to be the maximum pair, two conditions must hold:\n\n1. G must be paired with L (probability 1/11, since G has 11 possible partners).\n\n2. All other pairs must be lex smaller than GL.",
    "But GL is a pair starting with G. For GL to be the maximum pair, there must be no pairs starting with letters after G (i.e., H, I, J, K, L). However, L is already paired with G, so the remaining letters H, I, J, K must be paired among themselves and the other letters (A-F). Wait, but letters A-F are before G, so pairs starting with A-F can't be higher than GL if there's a pair starting with H, I, J, K.",
    "Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think step by step.",
    "Suppose G is paired with L, forming GL. For GL to be the maximum pair, all other pairs must be lex smaller than GL. Since GL starts with G, any pair starting with a letter after G (H, I, J, K) would be lex greater than GL. Therefore, for GL to be the maximum pair, there must be no pairs starting with H, I, J, or K. But H, I, J, K are still in the remaining letters. So, if G is paired with L, then the remaining letters are A-F, H, I, J, K. These 10 letters need to be paired into 5 pairs. For there to be no pairs starting with H, I, J, K, all these letters (H, I, J, K) must be paired with letters that come after them. But since H, I, J, K are all before L, and L is already paired with G, the letters after H are I, J, K, L, but L is already paired. Wait, no. When pairing H, I, J, K with the remaining letters (A-F, H, I, J, K). Wait, letters A-F are before G, and H, I, J, K are after G but before L.\n\nWait, letters remaining after pairing G with L: A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K.\n\nThese 10 letters need to be paired into 5 pairs. For there to be no pairs starting with H, I, J, K, each of these letters (H, I, J, K) must be paired with a letter that comes before them. Because if any of H, I, J, K is paired with a letter that comes after them, then the pair would start with the earlier letter. Wait, no. If H is paired with I, since H comes before I, the pair is HI. Similarly, H paired with J is HJ, etc. So, pairs starting with H, I, J, K can only be formed if they are paired with letters after them. But since H, I, J, K are among the latest letters remaining (A-F are earlier), pairing H with A would result in AH, which starts with A. Pairing H with I would result in HI, starting with H.",
    "Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nWhen pairing letters, each pair is ordered alphabetically. So, if H is paired with A, the pair is AH. If H is paired with I, it's HI. If H is paired with J, it's HJ, etc. Similarly, I paired with J is IJ, I paired with K is IK, etc.\n\nTherefore, pairs starting with H, I, J, K can only be formed if the paired letter is after H, I, J, K respectively. Since the remaining letters are A-F, H, I, J, K.",
    "So, for example, H can be paired with A-F, which would result in pairs starting with A-F, or with I, J, K, resulting in HI, HJ, HK. Similarly, I can be paired with A-F, H, J, K, resulting in pairs starting with A-F, H, or I (if paired with J or K: IJ, IK). Wait, no—if I is paired with J, since I comes before J, the pair is IJ. If I is paired with K, it's IK. So, pairs starting with I would be IJ, IK. Similarly, J paired with K is JK.\n\nTherefore, in the remaining letters (A-F, H, I, J, K), the pairs starting with H, I, J, K are HI, HJ, HK, IJ, IK, JK. All other pairs would start with A-F.\n\nTherefore, for there to be no pairs starting with H, I, J, K, we must pair all H, I, J, K with letters from A-F. Because if any of H, I, J, K is paired with another letter from H, I, J, K, then the pair would start with H, I, J, or K.\n\nTherefore, the condition for GL to be the maximum pair is that all H, I, J, K are paired with A-F. So, H, I, J, K must each be paired with someone from A-F. Since there are 4 letters (H, I, J, K) and 6 letters (A-F). So, we need to pair each of H, I, J, K with someone from A-F, and the remaining 2 letters from A-F are paired among themselves.\n\nThe number of ways to do this is: First, choose 4 letters from A-F to pair with H, I, J, K. The number of ways is C(6, 4) * 4! (since we assign each of H, I, J, K to one of the 4 chosen letters). Then, the remaining 2 letters from A-F are paired together, and the remaining 0 letters from H, I, J, K (since all are paired). Wait, but H, I, J, K are 4 letters, and we pair each with a distinct letter from A-F (which has 6). So, we need to choose 4 distinct letters from A-F and pair them with H, I, J, K. The number of ways is P(6, 4) = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3. Then, the remaining 2 letters from A-F can be paired in 1 way (since order doesn't matter). Wait, but pairings are unordered. So, actually, the number of ways is:\n\nFirst, choose 4 letters from A-F: C(6, 4).\n\nThen, assign each of H, I, J, K to one of these 4 letters: 4! ways.\n\nThen, pair the remaining 2 letters from A-F: 1 way.\n\nBut actually, in terms of perfect matchings, the total number of ways to pair the remaining 10 letters is (10)! / (2^5 5!). However, the number of favorable pairings where H, I, J, K are all paired with A-F is:\n\nFirst, pair H, I, J, K with 4 distinct letters from A-F. The number of ways is C(6, 4) * 4! * (2)! / (2^1 1!) ). Wait, no. Let's think differently.\n\nTotal number of ways to pair the remaining 10 letters: 9!! = 945 (since 10 letters can be paired in 9*7*5*3*1 = 945 ways).\n\nNumber of favorable ways: We need to pair H, I, J, K each with someone from A-F, and the remaining two from A-F are paired together.\n\nTo compute this:\n\nFirst, pair H with someone from A-F: 6 choices.\n\nThen, pair I with someone from the remaining 5 in A-F: 5 choices.\n\nThen, pair J with someone from the remaining 4 in A-F: 4 choices.\n\nThen, pair K with someone from the remaining 3 in A-F: 3 choices.\n\nThen, pair the remaining 2 letters in A-F: 1 way.\n\nHowever, this counts the number of ordered pairings. Since pairings are unordered, we need to divide by the number of orderings of the pairs. But since we are counting distinct pairings, actually, this product (6*5*4*3*1) is equal to 6*5*4*3 = 360. But the total number of pairings is 945. Therefore, the probability is 360 / 945 = 24 / 63 = 8 / 21. Wait, but let's verify.",
    "Wait, total number of pairings for 10 letters: (10-1)!! = 945. Correct.\n\nNumber of favorable pairings: Assign H, I, J, K to 4 distinct letters from A-F. The number of ways is 6*5*4*3 = 360, and then pair the remaining 2 letters: 1 way. So total favorable pairings: 360.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 360 / 945 = 360 / 945. Simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 45: 8 / 21.\n\nTherefore, if G is paired with L, the probability that GL is the maximum pair is 8/21.\n\nBut wait, the probability that G is paired with L is 1/11, and given that pairing, the probability that all other pairs don't have H, I, J, K starting pairs is 8/21. Therefore, the contribution to the total probability from G being paired with L is (1/11) * (8/21).\n\nSimilarly, we need to consider other pairings of G where G is paired with letters such that their pair could be the maximum.\n\nFor example, suppose G is paired with K. Then, the pair is GK. For GK to be the maximum pair, two conditions must hold:\n\n1. G is paired with K (probability 1/11).\n\n2. All other pairs must be lex smaller than GK.",
    "For GK to be the maximum pair, there must be no pairs starting with G, H, I, J, K, L. Wait, GK starts with G. Letters after G are H, I, J, K, L. So, pairs starting with H, I, J, K, L would be lex greater than GK. Therefore, for GK to be the maximum pair, there must be no pairs starting with H, I, J, K, L.\n\nBut L is still in the remaining letters. Wait, if G is paired with K, then the remaining letters are A-F, H, I, J, L. So, letters H, I, J, L must be paired such that none of them form a pair starting with H, I, J, K, or L. Wait, but K is already paired with G. So, remaining letters: A-F, H, I, J, L.\n\nSo, similar to before, but now L is present. So, pairs starting with H, I, J, L would be lex greater than GK. Therefore, to have GK as the maximum pair, all pairs involving H, I, J, L must be paired with letters before them.\n\nSo, H must be paired with A-F, I must be paired with A-F, J must be paired with A-F, L must be paired with A-F.\n\nSo, the remaining letters are A-F (6 letters) and H, I, J, L (4 letters). So, total 10 letters. We need to pair H, I, J, L each with someone from A-F, and the remaining two letters from A-F are paired together.\n\nNumber of ways to do this: similar to before.\n\nNumber of favorable pairings: Assign H, I, J, L to 4 distinct letters from A-F. The number of ways is 6*5*4*3 = 360. Then pair the remaining 2 letters from A-F: 1 way. Total favorable pairings: 360.\n\nTotal pairings: 945. So, probability is 360/945 = 8/21.\n\nTherefore, if G is paired with K, the probability that GK is the maximum pair is 8/21. Therefore, the contribution to the total probability is (1/11) * (8/21).\n\nSimilarly, if G is paired with J, forming GJ. For GJ to be the maximum pair, all pairs starting with H, I, J, K, L must not exist. But J is paired with G, so remaining letters: A-F, H, I, K, L.\n\nSo, H, I, K, L must be paired with A-F. Number of favorable pairings: Assign H, I, K, L to 4 distinct letters from A-F: 6*5*4*3 = 360. Pair remaining 2 letters from A-F: 1 way. Total favorable pairings: 360. Probability: 360/945 = 8/21. Therefore, contribution is (1/11) * (8/21).",
    "Wait, this seems to be a pattern. If G is paired with any letter from H to L, then the probability that their pair is the maximum is 8/21. Wait, let's check with G paired with H.\n\nIf G is paired with H, forming GH. For GH to be the maximum pair, all pairs starting with H, I, J, K, L must not exist. But H is paired with G, so remaining letters: A-F, I, J, K, L.\n\nSo, I, J, K, L must be paired with A-F. Number of favorable pairings: Assign I, J, K, L to 4 distinct letters from A-F: 6*5*4*3 = 360. Pair remaining 2 letters from A-F: 1 way. Total favorable pairings: 360. Probability: 360/945 = 8/21. Contribution: (1/11)*(8/21).\n\nSimilarly, if G is paired with I, forming GI. Then, remaining letters: A-F, H, J, K, L. So, H, J, K, L must be paired with A-F. Same calculation: 6*5*4*3 = 360. Probability 8/21. Contribution (1/11)*(8/21).\n\nSame for G paired with L, K, J, I, H: each case contributes (1/11)*(8/21).",
    "But wait, G can be paired with letters from A to L, excluding itself. So, possible partners are A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K, L.\n\nBut when G is paired with someone before G (A-F), then the pair would be ordered as (partner, G), since partner comes before G. For example, if G is paired with A, the pair is AG.\n\nIn this case, AG starts with A. For AG to be the maximum pair, all other pairs must start with letters before A, which is impossible. Therefore, if G is paired with someone before G (A-F), then their pair cannot be the maximum pair, because there will definitely be pairs starting with B, C, etc., up to L.\n\nTherefore, only when G is paired with someone after G (H, I, J, K, L) can their pair possibly be the maximum pair. Because in those cases, the pair starts with G, and for it to be the maximum pair, there must be no pairs starting with H, I, J, K, L.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is the sum over all possible partners of G after G (H, I, J, K, L) of the probability that G pairs with them and that their pair is the maximum.\n\nThere are 5 such partners: H, I, J, K, L.\n\nFor each partner, the probability is (1/11) * (8/21).\n\nTherefore, total probability is 5 * (1/11) * (8/21) = 40/231.\n\nSimplify 40/231: divide numerator and denominator by GCD(40,231). Factors of 40: 2^3 * 5. Factors of 231: 3 * 7 * 11. No common factors. Therefore, 40/231 is reduced.\n\nTherefore, m = 40, n = 231. So, m + n = 271.",
    "Wait, but wait. Let me verify this calculation again.\n\nTotal partners after G: H, I, J, K, L. That's 5 letters.\n\nFor each, probability G pairs with them is 1/11.\n\nGiven that pairing, the probability that all other pairs don't have higher starting letters is 8/21.\n\nTherefore, total probability is 5*(1/11)*(8/21) = (5*8)/(11*21) = 40/231.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me check the 8/21 factor again. When we pair G with, say, H, then the remaining letters are A-F, I, J, K, L. We need to pair I, J, K, L with A-F. The number of ways to do this is 6*5*4*3 = 360. Total pairings of remaining 10 letters is 945. 360/945 = 8/21. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for other pairings. Therefore, the 8/21 factor is correct.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is 40/231. 40 and 231 are coprime since 40 is 2^3*5 and 231 is 3*7*11. So, yes, reduced fraction.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 40 + 231 = 271.",
    "But wait, let me check once more. Suppose G is paired with L. Then, remaining letters are A-F, H, I, J, K. We need to pair H, I, J, K with A-F. The number of ways is C(6,4)*4! = 15*24 = 360. Total pairings: 945. 360/945 = 8/21. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, if G is paired with K, remaining letters A-F, H, I, J, L. Pair H, I, J, L with A-F: same calculation. 360/945 = 8/21.\n\nSame for J, I, H. Therefore, each of the 5 pairings contributes 8/21, multiplied by 1/11.\n\nTherefore, total probability 5*(8)/(11*21) = 40/231. So, m + n = 40 + 231 = 271.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the probability that the last word listed contains G\". So, this answer seems correct.",
    "Wait, but let me think differently. Suppose instead of fixing G's partner, we consider the probability that G is in the last pair, regardless of who it's paired with.\n\nThe last pair is the lex greatest pair. The probability that G is in the lex greatest pair is equal to the probability that G is paired with the \"right\" partner such that their pair is the maximum.\n\nBut how many possible maximum pairs are there? The maximum pair is KL if it exists. If not, JL if it exists, etc. So, the maximum pair is determined by the highest possible pair available.",
    "Alternatively, think of the maximum pair as the highest pair in the entire set of pairs. The probability that G is in that pair.",
    "Alternatively, note that each letter has an equal chance to be in the maximum pair. There are 12 letters, and the maximum pair contains 2 letters. So, the probability that any particular letter (G) is in the maximum pair is 2/12 = 1/6. But this is only true if the maximum pair is equally likely to be any pair, which is not the case. Because pairs are not equally likely to be the maximum. For example, KL is more likely to be the maximum pair than AB, because KL is lex greatest and can only be beaten if it's not formed.\n\nTherefore, the probability is not uniform.\n\nTherefore, that approach is invalid.",
    "Alternatively, consider that the probability that G is in the maximum pair is equal to the sum over all possible pairs containing G of the probability that that pair is the maximum pair.\n\nAs we calculated earlier, there are 5 pairs containing G that could possibly be the maximum pair: GH, GI, GJ, GK, GL. Each of these pairs, when formed, has a certain probability of being the maximum pair, which we calculated as 8/21 for each, given that G is paired with that specific letter.\n\nTherefore, total probability is 5*(1/11)*(8/21) = 40/231 ≈ 0.173, which is approximately 17.3%.\n\nBut let me verify this with a smaller case to see if the approach holds.\n\nSuppose we have only 4 letters: A, B, C, D. We want the probability that the last word contains B.\n\nPossible pairings:\n\nPossible pairings are:\n\n1. AB, CD\n\n2. AC, BD\n\n3. AD, BC\n\n4. BC, AD\n\n5. BD, AC\n\n6. CD, AB\n\nWait, but actually, the number of pairings is 3 for 4 letters. Wait, no: for 4 letters, the number of pairings is 3. For example:\n\n1. (AB, CD)\n\n2. (AC, BD)\n\n3. (AD, BC)\n\nEach of these has two pairs. Then, ordered alphabetically:\n\nFor pairing 1: AB, CD. Sorted: AB, CD. Last word is CD, which contains D.\n\nPairing 2: AC, BD. Sorted: AC, BD. Last word is BD, contains B.\n\nPairing 3: AD, BC. Sorted: AD, BC. Last word is BC, contains B.\n\nSo, out of 3 possible pairings, in two of them the last word contains B. Therefore, probability is 2/3.\n\nUsing our formula:\n\nLetters are A, B, C, D. We want the probability that the last word contains B.\n\nPossible pairs involving B: BA, BC, BD. Ordered as AB, BC, BD.\n\nThe maximum pair can be CD, BD, BC, or AD, etc.\n\nBut according to our previous approach:\n\nFor B to be in the last pair, B must be paired with C or D.\n\nIf B is paired with C: BC. For BC to be the maximum pair, there must be no pairs starting with C or D. The remaining letters are A and D. Pairing A and D gives AD, which starts with A. Therefore, BC would be the maximum pair. So, if B is paired with C, probability BC is maximum is 1.\n\nSimilarly, if B is paired with D: BD. Remaining letters are A and C. Pair AC or CA, which is AC. So, BD is greater than AC. Therefore, BD is the maximum pair.\n\nIf B is paired with A: AB. Remaining pairs are CD or others. CD is greater than AB. Therefore, AB is not the maximum.\n\nTherefore, when B is paired with C or D (probability 2/3), the pair is maximum. Therefore, probability is 2/3, which matches the actual count.\n\nUsing our formula:\n\nNumber of possible partners after B: C, D (2 letters).\n\nFor each partner, probability B pairs with them is 1/3 (since 3 partners: A, C, D).\n\nGiven pairing with C, probability BC is maximum: remaining letters A and D must be paired as AD. So, number of favorable pairings: 1 (AD). Total pairings: 1 (since only one way to pair A and D). Therefore, probability 1/1 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, pairing B with D: remaining letters A and C can only pair as AC. Probability BD is maximum: 1.\n\nTherefore, total probability: (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*1 = 2/3.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nIn this case, our formula works. So, extending this to the original problem, the approach seems valid.\n\nTherefore, returning to the original problem, the answer should be 40/231, so m + n = 271.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{271}\n"
