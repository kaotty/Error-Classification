      "content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's given and what's being asked. So, we have a piecewise linear function f(x) that's periodic with period 4. It's defined as x when x is between -1 and 1, and 2 - x when x is between 1 and 3. Then it repeats every 4 units. The graph is a sawtooth pattern, which makes sense because piecewise linear functions with periodic extensions typically create that kind of shape.\n\nThe problem mentions a parabola given by the equation x = 34y². We need to find the points where this parabola intersects the graph of f(x). Then, sum up all the y-coordinates of these intersection points and express the sum in a specific form (a + b√c)/d, where a, b, c, d are positive integers with certain conditions (gcd 1, c square-free, etc.), and then find a + b + c + d.\n\nAlright, so first, let's visualize both functions. The parabola x = 34y² opens to the right, symmetric about the x-axis. The sawtooth function f(x) is periodic, so it's going to repeat every 4 units. Since f(x) is piecewise linear, each period consists of two line segments: one from (-1, -1) to (1, 1) with slope 1, and another from (1, 1) to (3, -1) with slope -1, then repeating.\n\nTo find the intersection points, we need to solve for x and y such that both equations are satisfied: x = 34y² and y = f(x). Wait, hold on. Actually, f(x) is a function of x, so y = f(x). So substituting x = 34y² into y = f(x) gives y = f(34y²). So we can write y = f(34y²). Therefore, the equation to solve is y = f(34y²).",

      "content": "But since f is periodic with period 4, f(34y²) = f(34y² mod 4). Because f(x + 4k) = f(x) for any integer k. So 34y² mod 4 would give us the equivalent x in the interval [-1, 3), right? Wait, the function f(x) is defined over [-1,3) and repeats every 4 units. So any real number x can be written as x = 4k + t, where t is in [-1, 3), and then f(x) = f(t). Therefore, 34y² mod 4 will give us t, and then f(34y²) = f(t).\n\nFirst, compute 34y² mod 4. Since 34 divided by 4 is 8 with a remainder of 2. So 34 ≡ 2 mod 4. Therefore, 34y² ≡ 2y² mod 4. So 34y² mod 4 = (2y²) mod 4. Therefore, t = 2y² mod 4. But we need to map this into the interval [-1, 3). So t is equivalent to 2y² - 4k, where k is an integer such that t ∈ [-1, 3).

      "content": "Alternatively, maybe it's easier to consider that x = 34y², and since f(x) is periodic with period 4, we can write x as 4n + t where t ∈ [-1, 3) and n is an integer. Therefore, x = 34y² = 4n + t, so t = 34y² - 4n. Then f(x) = f(t). So y = f(t). Depending on the value of t in [-1,1) or [1,3), f(t) is either t or 2 - t.\n\nTherefore, we can split into two cases:\n\nCase 1: t ∈ [-1,1), so f(t) = t. Then y = t. But t = 34y² - 4n. Therefore, substituting y = t into t = 34y² - 4n gives t = 34t² - 4n. Rearranged: 34t² - t - 4n = 0.\n\nBut since t ∈ [-1,1), and n is an integer such that x = 4n + t = 34y², and y = t. Therefore, x = 34t². So 34t² = 4n + t. Therefore, 4n = 34t² - t. Since n must be an integer, 34t² - t must be divisible by 4.\n\nSimilarly, Case 2: t ∈ [1,3), so f(t) = 2 - t. Then y = 2 - t. Then t = 34y² - 4n. Substituting y = 2 - t into t = 34(2 - t)² - 4n. So t = 34(4 - 4t + t²) - 4n. Let's expand that: t = 34*4 - 34*4t + 34t² - 4n. Simplify: t = 136 - 136t + 34t² - 4n. Bring all terms to one side: 34t² - 137t + (136 - 4n) = 0.\n\nAgain, since t ∈ [1,3), and x = 34y² = 4n + t, with y = 2 - t. So x = 34(2 - t)^2 = 4n + t. Therefore, 34(4 - 4t + t²) = 4n + t => 136 - 136t + 34t² = 4n + t => 34t² - 137t + 136 = 4n. So similar to before, 34t² - 137t + 136 must be divisible by 4.\n\nThis seems complicated.

But since f(x) is a function, each x maps to one y. Wait, but when we solve x=34y² and y=f(x), we have y=f(x), so y is determined by x. Therefore, for each x in the sawtooth, y is fixed. Therefore, the intersection points are (x, y) where y=f(x) and x=34y². Therefore, substituting y=f(x) into x=34y² gives x=34[f(x)]², which is an equation in x.

So 2 -x can be negative or positive. For example, x=1: 2 -1=1. x=2: 2 -2=0. x=3: 2 -3=-1 (but x=3 is excluded). So y=2 -x can be positive or negative. Therefore, even though x is positive (since x=34y²), y can be negative here. Therefore, the parabola x=34y² will have points where y is positive and negative. But since x=34y² is symmetric about the x-axis, but f(x) is a function, so each x corresponds to one y. Therefore, for x in [1,3), y=2 -x can be positive or negative. Wait, no. Wait, when x ∈ [1,3), f(x)=2 -x. So y=2 -x. Therefore, if x ∈ [1,3), then y=2 -x ∈ (-1,1]. So when x=1, y=1; when x=2, y=0; when x approaches 3 from below, y approaches -1. Therefore, y can be negative here. Therefore, the intersection points in case 2 (x ∈ [1,3)) will have y=2 -x which can be positive or negative.\n\nBut when we solve x=34y² with y=2 -x, substituting gives x=34(2 -x)^2.

      "content": "Wait, that can't be right. The sum of y-coordinates is zero? That seems surprising. But let's check:\n\nSum = 0 + 1/34 + [(-1 +√273)/68 + (-1 -√273)/68]\n\nThe last two terms: (-1 +√273 -1 -√273)/68 = (-2)/68 = -1/34\n\nTherefore, Sum =0 +1/34 -1/34=0. So sum is zero? But that seems counterintuitive. However, mathematically, it's correct because the positive and negative roots cancel out. But wait, does the problem say \"the sum of the y-coordinates of these intersection points\"? If the intersections include symmetric points with positive and negative y, their sum could be zero. But let's check if there are intersections in other periods.\n\nWait, we considered only k=0. But x=34y² can be in higher intervals [4k -1,4k +3) for k ≥0. Wait, x=34y² can be very large as y increases. However, f(x) is periodic, so for each period, there might be intersections. But the problem states that the parabola intersects the graph of f(x) at finitely many points. So why finitely? Because as y increases, x=34y² increases, but f(x) is periodic. However, since the parabola x=34y² is increasing, each period [4k -1,4k +3) can have at most two intersections (since each linear piece can intersect a parabola at two points). But if x=34y² grows beyond all bounds, wouldn't it intersect each period twice? Leading to infinitely many intersections? But the problem says finitely many points. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in considering k=0 only. Wait, let's think again. The problem says \"the parabola x=34y² intersects the graph of f(x) at finitely many points\". But if f(x) is periodic and the parabola is unbounded, they should intersect infinitely many times. But the problem says finitely many points. Therefore, perhaps there's a restriction I missed.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: \"The parabola x=34y² intersects the graph of f(x) at finitely many points.\" So maybe due to the specific coefficients, the intersections only occur in a finite number of periods? For example, maybe for higher k, the equation x=34y² with x in [4k -1,4k +3) has no solution. Let's check.\n\nSuppose we take k=1: x ∈ [3,7). Then x=34y² must be in [3,7). So y² ∈ [3/34,7/34) ≈ [0.088,0.206). So y ∈ (-0.454, -0.296) ∪ (0.296,0.454). Then f(x) for x ∈ [3,7) is equal to f(x -4), since f(x)=f(x -4). So x -4 ∈ [-1,3). Therefore, f(x)=f(x -4). So similar to k=0, but shifted.\n\nSo for x ∈ [3,7), f(x)=f(x -4). So if x ∈ [3,5), then x -4 ∈ [-1,1), so f(x)=x -4. If x ∈ [5,7), then x -4 ∈ [1,3), so f(x)=2 - (x -4)=6 -x.\n\nTherefore, substituting into x=34y²:\n\nCase 1: x ∈ [3,5). Then y=f(x)=x -4. So x=34(x -4)^2. Solve:34x² -272x +544 -x=0 →34x² -273x +544=0.\n\nCase 2: x ∈ [5,7). Then y=f(x)=6 -x. So x=34(6 -x)^2. Expand: x=34(36 -12x +x²) →x=1224 -408x +34x² →34x² -409x +1224=0.\n\nNow, solving these quadratics:\n\nCase 1:34x² -273x +544=0\n\nDiscriminant:273² -4*34*544\n\nCalculate:\n\n273²=74529\n\n4*34*544=4*34=136; 136*544=73984\n\nSo discriminant=74529 -73984=545\n\n√545≈23.34\n\nSolutions:x=(273 ±√545)/68≈(273 ±23.34)/68\n\nx≈(273 +23.34)/68≈296.34/68≈4.358\n\nx≈(273 -23.34)/68≈249.66/68≈3.672\n\nCheck if these x are in [3,5). Both 3.672 and 4.358 are in [3,5). So two solutions here.\n\nThen y=x -4≈-0.328 and y≈0.358.\n\nCase 2:34x² -409x +1224=0\n\nDiscriminant:409² -4*34*1224\n\nCalculate:\n\n409²=167,281\n\n4*34=136;136*1224=166, 464\n\nWait, 1224*100=122,400; 1224*36=44,064. Total 1224*136=166,464.\n\nSo discriminant=167,281 -166,464=817\n\n√817≈28.58\n\nSolutions:x=(409 ±28.58)/68≈(437.58)/68≈6.435 and (380.42)/68≈5.594\n\nCheck if in [5,7). Both 5.594 and 6.435 are in [5,7). Therefore, two solutions here.\n\nThen y=6 -x≈0.406 and y≈-0.435.\n\nTherefore, for k=1, total four intersection points with y≈-0.328,0.358,0.406,-0.435. Summing these y-coordinates would again give cancellation between positive and negative terms. Similarly, sum≈-0.328 +0.358 +0.406 -0.435≈(-0.328 -0.435) + (0.358 +0.406)= -0.763 +0.764≈0.001≈0.

Let me check:\n\n\"A piecewise linear periodic function is defined by f(x)=begin{cases}x&text{if }x∈[-1,1)\\2 -x&text{if }x∈[1,3)end{cases} and f(x+4)=f(x) for all real numbers x.\"\n\nYes, that's correct. So f(x) is a sawtooth function with period 4, going from -1 to 1 with slope 1, then from 1 to -1 with slope -1 over the next 2 units, then repeating.\n\nThe parabola x=34y² is a standard right-opening parabola. The intersection points would occur where x=34y² and y=f(x). Therefore, substituting y=f(x) into x=34y² gives x=34[f(x)]². Since f(x) is periodic, this equation must be solved over each period.\n\nBut since x=34[f(x)]² must lie within the same period as x. However, x=34[f(x)]² can be much larger than the period, leading to solutions in higher periods. However, the problem states there are finitely many intersection points, which suggests that beyond a certain period, the equation x=34[f(x)]² has no solutions.\n\nBut why?\n\nLet's analyze the equation x=34[f(x)]².\n\nSince f(x) is periodic with period 4, [f(x)]² is also periodic with period 4. Therefore, x=34[f(x)]² implies that x must be a multiple of 34 times a periodic function squared. However, x itself is not periodic, so this equation requires that x matches 34 times the square of its own periodic part.\n\nThis seems challenging, but perhaps there's a way to bound the solutions.\n\nNote that [f(x)]² ≤1, since f(x) ∈ (-1,1] for x ∈ [-1,3), and hence for all x due to periodicity. Therefore, x=34[f(x)]² ≤34*1=34. Therefore, x ≤34. Therefore, the intersection points can only occur where x ≤34. Therefore, x ∈ [0,34]. Therefore, k such that 4k -1 ≤34. So 4k ≤35 →k ≤8.75. Therefore, k=0,1,2,...,8. Therefore, finite number of periods. Therefore, finitely many intersection points.\n\nAh! This is the key point. Since [f(x)]² ≤1, because f(x) is between -1 and 1 (excluding -1 and including 1). Therefore, x=34[f(x)]² ≤34*1=34. Therefore, x must be ≤34. Therefore, the intersections can only occur where x ≤34. Therefore, x ∈ [0,34]. Therefore, the possible k's are from k=0 up to k=8, since 4*8 +3=35, which is greater than34. Therefore, k=0 to k=8.\n\nBut wait, x=34[f(x)]² ≤34, so x ≤34. Therefore, x ∈ [0,34]. Therefore, the periods intersected are k=0 (x ∈ [0,3)), k=1 (x ∈ [3,7)),..., up to k=8 (x ∈ [31,35)). But x=34 is in k=8's interval [31,35). Therefore, total k=0 to k=8.\n\nTherefore, there are 9 periods to consider. For each k=0 to8, solve the quadratic equations in Case 1 and Case 2, check if solutions lie within the respective intervals, and sum the y-coordinates.\n\nHowever, this would be time-consuming, but since the sum for each k cancels out to zero (as observed earlier), except for k=0 where there's a solution at x=0 (y=0) which doesn't have a corresponding negative pair, but in reality, for k=0, we have y=0, y=1/34, y=(-1 +√273)/68, and y=(-1 -√273)/68.

Therefore, contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in our approach. Let's re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the sum of the y-coordinates of these intersection points\". If the intersections are symmetric about the x-axis, positive and negative y's would cancel. However, f(x) is not symmetric about the x-axis. Wait, f(x) is an odd function?\n\nWait, f(x) defined on [-1,1) as x, and on [1,3) as 2 -x. Let's check symmetry:\n\nFor x in [-1,1), f(-x)=-x=-f(x).\n\nFor x in [1,3), let's take x=2 +t where t ∈ [-1,1). Then f(x)=2 -x=2 -(2 +t)=-t=-f(-x). Because f(-x)=f(-(2 +t))=f(-2 -t +4)=f(2 -t)=2 -(2 -t)=t. Therefore, f(-x)=t=-f(x). Therefore, f(-x)=-f(x). Therefore, f(x) is an odd function.\n\nTherefore, the graph of f(x) is symmetric about the origin. Therefore, if (x,y) is an intersection point, then (-x,-y) is also an intersection point. However, since x=34y² is always non-negative, x ≥0. Therefore, for every intersection point (x,y) with y>0, there is a corresponding point (x,-y) only if x=34(-y)^2=34y²=x. But y=f(x), and since f(x) is odd, if y=f(x), then -y=f(-x). But x=34y² implies -x=34(-y)^2=34y², which would imply x=0. Therefore, except for x=0, there are no symmetric points. Therefore, only the point (0,0) is self-symmetric. All other points have x>0 and y determined by f(x). Since f(x) is odd, but x is non-negative, there's no symmetry to cancel y-coordinates. Therefore, our earlier conclusion that the sum is zero is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, there's a mistake in assuming symmetry. Let's re-express the problem.\n\nGiven x=34y² and y=f(x), and f(x) is odd, but x ≥0. Therefore, all intersection points must have x ≥0 and y=f(x). Since f(x) is odd, for x>0, y=f(x) can be positive or negative. However, x=34y² implies that if y is negative, x is still positive. Therefore, each solution y corresponds to x=34y². Therefore, the sum of y-coordinates is the sum of all real solutions y of y=f(34y²).\n\nBut since f is periodic, f(34y²)=f(34y² mod4). Let's denote z=34y² mod4. Then f(z)=y.\n\nBut 34y² mod4= (34 mod4)y² mod4=2y² mod4.\n\nTherefore, z=2y² mod4, and y=f(z).\n\nBut z ∈ [-1,3). However, z=2y² mod4. Since 2y² is always non-negative, z=2y² -4k for some integer k ≥0 such that z ∈ [-1,3).\n\nTherefore, z=2y² -4k ∈ [-1,3). Therefore, 2y² -4k ≥-1 and 2y² -4k <3.\n\nRearranged:\n\n4k -1 ≤2y² <4k +3.\n\nTherefore, y² ∈ [ (4k -1)/2, (4k +3)/2 ).\n\nBut y² ≥0, so (4k -1)/2 ≥0 →k ≥1/4. Since k is integer, k ≥0.\n\nTherefore, for each k ≥0, y² ∈ [max(0, (4k -1)/2), (4k +3)/2).\n\nBut y=f(z)=f(2y² -4k).\n\nDepending on z=2y² -4k:\n\nIf z ∈ [-1,1), then f(z)=z=2y² -4k.\n\nIf z ∈ [1,3), then f(z)=2 -z=2 - (2y² -4k)=2 -2y² +4k.\n\nTherefore, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: z ∈ [-1,1) →2y² -4k ∈ [-1,1).\n\nThus:\n\n-1 ≤2y² -4k <1 →4k -1 ≤2y² <4k +1.\n\nThen y=f(z)=2y² -4k.\n\nTherefore, y=2y² -4k →2y² -y -4k=0.\n\nCase 2: z ∈ [1,3) →2y² -4k ∈ [1,3).\n\nThus:\n\n1 ≤2y² -4k <3 →4k +1 ≤2y² <4k +3.\n\nThen y=f(z)=2 - (2y² -4k)=2 -2y² +4k.\n\nTherefore, y=2 -2y² +4k →2y² +y - (4k +2)=0.\n\nTherefore, for each k ≥0, we have two quadratic equations:\n\nCase 1:2y² -y -4k=0, with y² ∈ [ (4k -1)/2, (4k +1)/2 )\n\nCase 2:2y² +y - (4k +2)=0, with y² ∈ [ (4k +1)/2, (4k +3)/2 )\n\nWe need to solve these equations for y and check if y² lies in the respective intervals.\n\nLet's analyze Case 1:\n\nEquation:2y² -y -4k=0.\n\nSolutions:\n\ny=[1 ±√(1 +32k)]/4.\n\nSince y² must be ≥(4k -1)/2 and <(4k +1)/2.\n\nSimilarly, Case 2:\n\nEquation:2y² +y - (4k +2)=0.\n\nSolutions:\n\ny=[-1 ±√(1 +32k +16)]/4=[-1 ±√(32k +17)]/4.\n\nAnd y² must be ≥(4k +1)/2 and <(4k +3)/2.\n\nBut this approach seems complicated. However, since the problem states finitely many solutions, there must be a maximum k for which these equations have real solutions.\n\nLet's find the maximum k such that Case 1 or Case 2 has real solutions.\n\nFor Case 1:\n\nDiscriminant=1 +32k ≥0 →k ≥0.\n\nBut y² must be ≥(4k -1)/2 and <(4k +1)/2.\n\nSimilarly, for Case 2:\n\nDiscriminant=1 +32k +16=32k +17 ≥0 →k ≥0.\n\nBut y² must be ≥(4k +1)/2 and <(4k +3)/2.\n\nLet's find k such that solutions exist.\n\nFor Case 1:\n\ny=[1 ±√(1 +32k)]/4.\n\nCompute y²:\n\ny²=[1 ±2√(1 +32k) +1 +32k]/16=[2 ±2√(1 +32k) +32k]/16=[1 ±√(1 +32k) +16k]/8.\n\nThis must lie in [(4k -1)/2, (4k +1)/2).\n\nSimilarly, for Case 2:\n\ny=[-1 ±√(32k +17)]/4.\n\nCompute y²:\n\ny²=[1 ±2√(32k +17) +32k +17]/16=[18 ±2√(32k +17) +32k]/16=[9 ±√(32k +17) +16k]/8.\n\nThis must lie in [(4k +1)/2, (4k +3)/2).\n\nThis seems very involved. However, given the problem's answer format, it's likely that only k=0 contributes to the sum, and higher k's either have no solutions or their contributions cancel out. But earlier analysis showed that for k=0, the sum is zero, which contradicts the problem's answer format.",

    "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's given and what's being asked. So, we have a piecewise linear function f(x) that's periodic with period 4. It's defined as x when x is between -1 and 1, and 2 - x when x is between 1 and 3. Then it repeats every 4 units. The graph is a sawtooth pattern, which makes sense because piecewise linear functions with periodic extensions typically create that kind of shape.\n\nThe problem mentions a parabola given by the equation x = 34y². We need to find the points where this parabola intersects the graph of f(x). Then, sum up all the y-coordinates of these intersection points and express the sum in a specific form (a + b√c)/d, where a, b, c, d are positive integers with certain conditions (gcd 1, c square-free, etc.), and then find a + b + c + d.\n\nAlright, so first, let's visualize both functions. The parabola x = 34y² opens to the right, symmetric about the x-axis. The sawtooth function f(x) is periodic, so it's going to repeat every 4 units. Since f(x) is piecewise linear, each period consists of two line segments: one from (-1, -1) to (1, 1) with slope 1, and another from (1, 1) to (3, -1) with slope -1, then repeating.\n\nTo find the intersection points, we need to solve for x and y such that both equations are satisfied: x = 34y² and y = f(x). Wait, hold on. Actually, f(x) is a function of x, so y = f(x). So substituting x = 34y² into y = f(x) gives y = f(34y²). So we can write y = f(34y²). Therefore, the equation to solve is y = f(34y²).",
    "But since f is periodic with period 4, f(34y²) = f(34y² mod 4). Because f(x + 4k) = f(x) for any integer k. So 34y² mod 4 would give us the equivalent x in the interval [-1, 3), right? Wait, the function f(x) is defined over [-1,3) and repeats every 4 units. So any real number x can be written as x = 4k + t, where t is in [-1, 3), and then f(x) = f(t). Therefore, 34y² mod 4 will give us t, and then f(34y²) = f(t).\n\nFirst, compute 34y² mod 4. Since 34 divided by 4 is 8 with a remainder of 2. So 34 ≡ 2 mod 4. Therefore, 34y² ≡ 2y² mod 4. So 34y² mod 4 = (2y²) mod 4. Therefore, t = 2y² mod 4. But we need to map this into the interval [-1, 3). So t is equivalent to 2y² - 4k, where k is an integer such that t ∈ [-1, 3). Therefore, depending on the value of y, t can be in different intervals.",
    "Alternatively, maybe it's easier to consider that x = 34y², and since f(x) is periodic with period 4, we can write x as 4n + t where t ∈ [-1, 3) and n is an integer. Therefore, x = 34y² = 4n + t, so t = 34y² - 4n. Then f(x) = f(t). So y = f(t). Depending on the value of t in [-1,1) or [1,3), f(t) is either t or 2 - t.\n\nTherefore, we can split into two cases:\n\nCase 1: t ∈ [-1,1), so f(t) = t. Then y = t. But t = 34y² - 4n. Therefore, substituting y = t into t = 34y² - 4n gives t = 34t² - 4n. Rearranged: 34t² - t - 4n = 0.\n\nBut since t ∈ [-1,1), and n is an integer such that x = 4n + t = 34y², and y = t. Therefore, x = 34t². So 34t² = 4n + t. Therefore, 4n = 34t² - t. Since n must be an integer, 34t² - t must be divisible by 4.\n\nSimilarly, Case 2: t ∈ [1,3), so f(t) = 2 - t. Then y = 2 - t. Then t = 34y² - 4n. Substituting y = 2 - t into t = 34(2 - t)² - 4n. So t = 34(4 - 4t + t²) - 4n. Let's expand that: t = 34*4 - 34*4t + 34t² - 4n. Simplify: t = 136 - 136t + 34t² - 4n. Bring all terms to one side: 34t² - 137t + (136 - 4n) = 0.\n\nAgain, since t ∈ [1,3), and x = 34y² = 4n + t, with y = 2 - t. So x = 34(2 - t)^2 = 4n + t. Therefore, 34(4 - 4t + t²) = 4n + t => 136 - 136t + 34t² = 4n + t => 34t² - 137t + 136 = 4n. So similar to before, 34t² - 137t + 136 must be divisible by 4.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach. Let's think differently.",
    "Since f(x) is periodic with period 4, and the parabola x = 34y² is not periodic, but since x increases as y², which grows rapidly, perhaps the intersections occur only within a certain range of x? Wait, but x can be as large as needed since y can be any real number. However, f(x) repeats every 4 units. So for each period of f(x), i.e., for each interval [4k -1, 4k +3), where k is an integer, the function f(x) is a sawtooth wave. The parabola x =34y² will intersect each of these periods in some number of points. But since x =34y² increases rapidly, maybe for large enough k, x=34y² will not intersect the k-th period? Wait, but x=34y² is a parabola opening to the right, so for any y, x is positive. Wait, but f(x) is defined for all real x, but since x=34y² is always non-negative, so x ≥0. Therefore, the intersections can only occur where f(x) is defined for x ≥0. Let's check the original definition.",
    "Looking back, f(x) is defined on [-1,3), then repeats every 4 units. So for x ≥0, the function is defined on [0,3), [4,7), [8,11), etc. Each interval [4k -1, 4k +3). But since x=34y² is positive, so intersections can only occur in intervals where x ≥0. So starting from k=0: [-1,3), but x ≥0 here is [0,3). Then next period is [3,7), but x=34y² would be x ≥0, so overlapping with [3,7), etc. Wait, but x=34y² can be in any interval [4k -1, 4k +3) where x=34y² falls into that interval.",
    "But perhaps since x=34y² grows quadratically, for each k, there may be two intersection points (since parabola can intersect a linear piece twice). But since the parabola is symmetric about the x-axis, maybe for each linear segment in f(x), there could be intersections in positive and negative y? Wait, but f(x) is a function, so for each x, there's only one y. However, the parabola x=34y² is a relation, so for each y, there's an x. But since f(x) is a function, each x maps to one y. So perhaps for each x in the sawtooth, if x=34y², then y = ±sqrt(x/34). But f(x) gives a unique y for each x. Wait, but the intersection points would be points (x, y) such that x=34y² and y = f(x). Therefore, substituting y = f(x) into x=34y² gives x = 34[f(x)]². So the equation to solve is x = 34[f(x)]².\n\nSo that's a different perspective. So x = 34[f(x)]². Since f(x) is periodic, we can write x = 34[f(x)]². But f(x) is piecewise linear, so we can split into cases based on the definition of f(x).\n\nGiven that f(x) is periodic with period 4, let's first figure out for x in [-1,3), f(x) is defined as x if x ∈ [-1,1), and 2 - x if x ∈ [1,3). Then repeats every 4 units.",
    "But since x =34y², and x must be in the domain of f(x). Wait, x can be in any interval [4k -1, 4k +3), but x=34y² is non-negative, so k must be such that 4k -1 ≤ x <4k +3. Since x=34y² ≥0, k starts from 0: 4*0 -1 =-1 ≤x<3, but x≥0, so x ∈ [0,3). Then next interval is k=1: [3,7), then k=2: [7,11), etc. So x=34y² can be in each interval [4k -1,4k +3) for k=0,1,2,... So each interval corresponds to different k. Therefore, for each k, x ∈ [4k -1,4k +3), and f(x) = f(x -4k), which is defined as:\n\nIf x ∈ [4k -1,4k +1), then f(x) = x -4k.\n\nIf x ∈ [4k +1,4k +3), then f(x) = 2 - (x -4k).\n\nSo substituting into x =34[f(x)]²:\n\nCase 1: x ∈ [4k -1,4k +1). Then f(x) = x -4k. So x =34(x -4k)^2.\n\nCase 2: x ∈ [4k +1,4k +3). Then f(x) = 2 - (x -4k). So x =34[2 - (x -4k)]².\n\nTherefore, for each k, we can solve these quadratic equations in the respective intervals.\n\nBut since x=34y² must lie in the interval [4k -1,4k +3), we can find for which k this is possible.\n\nGiven that x=34y² ≥0, so k starts from 0.\n\nFirst, let's consider k=0: x ∈ [-1,3), but x ≥0, so x ∈ [0,3). So in this interval, f(x) is defined as x when x ∈ [0,1), and 2 -x when x ∈ [1,3). Therefore, substituting into x=34y²:\n\nFor x ∈ [0,1): y = x. So x =34x². So equation: 34x² -x =0. Solutions x=0 or x=1/34. Since x ∈ [0,1), both solutions are valid. So x=0: y=0. x=1/34: y=1/34.\n\nFor x ∈ [1,3): y=2 -x. So x =34(2 -x)^2. Expand: x=34(4 -4x +x²). So x=34x² -136x +136. Bring all terms to left: 34x² -137x +136=0. Solve quadratic equation:\n\nx = [137 ±√(137² -4*34*136)]/(2*34)\n\nCalculate discriminant:\n\n137² = 18,769\n\n4*34*136 = 4*34*136 = 4*4,624 = 18,496\n\nSo discriminant =18,769 -18,496=273\n\nThus, x=(137 ±√273)/68\n\nNow check if these solutions lie in [1,3). Let's approximate √273 ≈16.524. So:\n\nx=(137 +16.524)/68 ≈153.524/68≈2.258\n\nx=(137 -16.524)/68≈120.476/68≈1.771",
    "Both 1.771 and 2.258 are in [1,3), so both solutions are valid. Therefore, for k=0, we have two solutions from case 1 (x=0 and x=1/34) and two solutions from case 2 (x≈1.771 and x≈2.258). Wait, but wait, in case 1 (x ∈ [0,1)), we had x=0 and x=1/34. In case 2 (x ∈ [1,3)), we had two solutions. So total four solutions for k=0? But wait, x=0 is in [0,1), so that's valid. x=1/34≈0.029 is also in [0,1). Then the two quadratic solutions in case 2 are in [1,3). So total four intersection points for k=0.",
    "But wait, parabola x=34y² intersects the sawtooth function f(x) in four points in the first period? Let me check.\n\nAt x=0, y=0. Then x=34y²=0, which is correct. Then x=1/34, y=1/34. Then x≈1.771 and x≈2.258. These x-values correspond to y=2 -x≈0.229 and y≈-0.258? Wait, hold on. Wait, in case 2, y=2 -x. So if x≈1.771, then y≈0.229. Similarly, x≈2.258, y≈-0.258. Wait, but y can be negative here? Wait, the parabola x=34y² is symmetric about the x-axis, so for each positive y, there's a corresponding negative y. But since f(x) is a function, each x maps to one y. Wait, but when we solve x=34y² and y=f(x), we have y=f(x), so y is determined by x. Therefore, for each x in the sawtooth, y is fixed. Therefore, the intersection points are (x, y) where y=f(x) and x=34y². Therefore, substituting y=f(x) into x=34y² gives x=34[f(x)]², which is an equation in x. So solving for x gives the x-coordinates, and then y is just f(x). Therefore, each solution x gives a unique y (either positive or negative). Wait, but f(x) can be positive or negative? Wait, f(x) is defined as x in [-1,1), so if x is in [0,1), f(x)=x is positive. If x is in [-1,0), f(x)=x is negative. But since x=34y² is non-negative, x must be in [0,3) for k=0. Therefore, in k=0, x ∈ [0,3), so f(x) is x ∈ [0,1) and 2 -x ∈ [ -1,1) when x ∈ [1,3). Wait, no. Wait, when x ∈ [1,3), f(x)=2 -x. So if x is in [1,3), then 2 -x is in (-1,1]. So 2 -x can be negative or positive. For example, x=1: 2 -1=1. x=2: 2 -2=0. x=3: 2 -3=-1 (but x=3 is excluded). So y=2 -x can be positive or negative. Therefore, even though x is positive (since x=34y²), y can be negative here. Therefore, the parabola x=34y² will have points where y is positive and negative. But since x=34y² is symmetric about the x-axis, but f(x) is a function, so each x corresponds to one y. Therefore, for x in [1,3), y=2 -x can be positive or negative. Wait, no. Wait, when x ∈ [1,3), f(x)=2 -x. So y=2 -x. Therefore, if x ∈ [1,3), then y=2 -x ∈ (-1,1]. So when x=1, y=1; when x=2, y=0; when x approaches 3 from below, y approaches -1. Therefore, y can be negative here. Therefore, the intersection points in case 2 (x ∈ [1,3)) will have y=2 -x which can be positive or negative.\n\nBut when we solve x=34y² with y=2 -x, substituting gives x=34(2 -x)^2. So solving this gives x ≈1.771 and x≈2.258. Then y=2 -x ≈0.229 and y≈-0.258. Therefore, these are two points: (1.771, 0.229) and (2.258, -0.258). Similarly, in case 1 (x ∈ [0,1)), solving x=34x² gives x=0 and x=1/34≈0.029, with y=x≈0 and y≈0.029. So these points are (0,0) and (0.029,0.029). So total four points in k=0.",
    "But wait, parabola x=34y² will pass through these four points. However, since the parabola is symmetric about the x-axis, but the function f(x) is not symmetric. So for each x, there's only one y. Therefore, the intersection points are indeed four points: two with positive y and two with negative y? Wait, no. Wait, in case 1 (x ∈ [0,1)), y=x, so positive. In case 2 (x ∈ [1,3)), y=2 -x, which can be positive or negative. So for x ∈ [1,2), y=2 -x is positive (since x <2), and for x ∈ [2,3), y=2 -x is negative (since x ≥2). Therefore, in case 2, the solutions x≈1.771 and x≈2.258 correspond to y≈0.229 and y≈-0.258. Therefore, two points with positive y and two points with negative y? Wait, no. Wait, x=1.771 is in [1,2), so y=2 -1.771≈0.229 (positive). x=2.258 is in [2,3), so y=2 -2.258≈-0.258 (negative). So two points: one positive y, one negative y. Similarly, in case 1, x=0 gives y=0, and x=1/34 gives y=1/34≈0.029 (positive). So total three points with y ≥0 and one point with y <0? Wait, x=0 gives y=0, x=1/34 gives y≈0.029, x≈1.771 gives y≈0.229, and x≈2.258 gives y≈-0.258. So total four points: three with y ≥0 and one with y <0. Wait, but y=0 is neither positive nor negative. So two positive y's (0.029 and 0.229), one zero, and one negative y (-0.258). But the problem states \"the sum of the y-coordinates of these intersection points\". So we need to sum all y-coordinates, including positive, negative, and zero.\n\nSo for k=0, the sum would be 0 + 1/34 + (137 -√273)/68 + (137 +√273)/68? Wait, wait. Wait, let's clarify. The solutions for case 1: x=0 and x=1/34, so y=0 and y=1/34. For case 2: x=(137 ±√273)/68, so y=2 -x. Therefore, y=2 - [(137 ±√273)/68] = (136 -137 ∓√273)/68 = (-1 ∓√273)/68. Wait, hold on. Let me compute y for case 2.\n\nWait, in case 2, x=34y² and y=2 -x. So substituting x=34y² into y=2 -x gives y=2 -34y². Therefore, rearranged: 34y² + y -2=0. So quadratic equation: 34y² + y -2=0. Solving:\n\ny = [-1 ±√(1 + 272)]/(2*34) = [-1 ±√273]/68.\n\nTherefore, y=(-1 +√273)/68 and y=(-1 -√273)/68. So these are the y-coordinates. Then x=34y².",
    "Wait, but earlier when solving x=34(2 -x)^2, we found x=(137 ±√273)/68. Then y=2 -x=2 - (137 ±√273)/68=(136 -137 ∓√273)/68=(-1 ∓√273)/68. So indeed, y=(-1 -√273)/68 and y=(-1 +√273)/68. Therefore, these are the two solutions for case 2.\n\nTherefore, summarizing:\n\nCase 1 (x ∈ [0,1)):\n\nSolutions:\n\nx=0: y=0\n\nx=1/34: y=1/34\n\nCase 2 (x ∈ [1,3)):\n\nSolutions:\n\ny=(-1 +√273)/68 ≈ ( -1 +16.524)/68≈15.524/68≈0.228\n\ny=(-1 -√273)/68≈( -1 -16.524)/68≈-17.524/68≈-0.258\n\nTherefore, total four solutions:\n\ny=0, y=1/34, y=(-1 +√273)/68, y=(-1 -√273)/68.\n\nTherefore, summing these y-coordinates:\n\nSum = 0 + 1/34 + (-1 +√273)/68 + (-1 -√273)/68\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n= 1/34 + [ (-1 +√273) + (-1 -√273) ] /68\n\n= 1/34 + [ -2 ] /68\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 1/34 - 2/68\n\nBut 2/68 =1/34, so:\n\n= 1/34 -1/34 =0",
    "Wait, that can't be right. The sum of y-coordinates is zero? That seems surprising. But let's check:\n\nSum = 0 + 1/34 + [(-1 +√273)/68 + (-1 -√273)/68]\n\nThe last two terms: (-1 +√273 -1 -√273)/68 = (-2)/68 = -1/34\n\nTherefore, Sum =0 +1/34 -1/34=0. So sum is zero? But that seems counterintuitive. However, mathematically, it's correct because the positive and negative roots cancel out. But wait, does the problem say \"the sum of the y-coordinates of these intersection points\"? If the intersections include symmetric points with positive and negative y, their sum could be zero. But let's check if there are intersections in other periods.\n\nWait, we considered only k=0. But x=34y² can be in higher intervals [4k -1,4k +3) for k ≥0. Wait, x=34y² can be very large as y increases. However, f(x) is periodic, so for each period, there might be intersections. But the problem states that the parabola intersects the graph of f(x) at finitely many points. So why finitely? Because as y increases, x=34y² increases, but f(x) is periodic. However, since the parabola x=34y² is increasing, each period [4k -1,4k +3) can have at most two intersections (since each linear piece can intersect a parabola at two points). But if x=34y² grows beyond all bounds, wouldn't it intersect each period twice? Leading to infinitely many intersections? But the problem says finitely many points. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in considering k=0 only. Wait, let's think again. The problem says \"the parabola x=34y² intersects the graph of f(x) at finitely many points\". But if f(x) is periodic and the parabola is unbounded, they should intersect infinitely many times. But the problem says finitely many points. Therefore, perhaps there's a restriction I missed.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: \"The parabola x=34y² intersects the graph of f(x) at finitely many points.\" So maybe due to the specific coefficients, the intersections only occur in a finite number of periods? For example, maybe for higher k, the equation x=34y² with x in [4k -1,4k +3) has no solution. Let's check.\n\nSuppose we take k=1: x ∈ [3,7). Then x=34y² must be in [3,7). So y² ∈ [3/34,7/34) ≈ [0.088,0.206). So y ∈ (-0.454, -0.296) ∪ (0.296,0.454). Then f(x) for x ∈ [3,7) is equal to f(x -4), since f(x)=f(x -4). So x -4 ∈ [-1,3). Therefore, f(x)=f(x -4). So similar to k=0, but shifted.\n\nSo for x ∈ [3,7), f(x)=f(x -4). So if x ∈ [3,5), then x -4 ∈ [-1,1), so f(x)=x -4. If x ∈ [5,7), then x -4 ∈ [1,3), so f(x)=2 - (x -4)=6 -x.\n\nTherefore, substituting into x=34y²:\n\nCase 1: x ∈ [3,5). Then y=f(x)=x -4. So x=34(x -4)^2. Solve:34x² -272x +544 -x=0 →34x² -273x +544=0.\n\nCase 2: x ∈ [5,7). Then y=f(x)=6 -x. So x=34(6 -x)^2. Expand: x=34(36 -12x +x²) →x=1224 -408x +34x² →34x² -409x +1224=0.\n\nNow, solving these quadratics:\n\nCase 1:34x² -273x +544=0\n\nDiscriminant:273² -4*34*544\n\nCalculate:\n\n273²=74529\n\n4*34*544=4*34=136; 136*544=73984\n\nSo discriminant=74529 -73984=545\n\n√545≈23.34\n\nSolutions:x=(273 ±√545)/68≈(273 ±23.34)/68\n\nx≈(273 +23.34)/68≈296.34/68≈4.358\n\nx≈(273 -23.34)/68≈249.66/68≈3.672\n\nCheck if these x are in [3,5).

    "But wait, for Case 2 in general:\n\nEquation:34x² -409x +1224=0 for k=1, which had solutions.\n\nFor k=4:34x² -1225x +11,016=0.\n\nDiscriminant=1225² -4*34*11,016=1,500,625 -1,498,176=2,449=49.98²≈49.98²≈2,449. Therefore, solutions exist.\n\nBut substituting back, x=34(18 -x)^2≈18.74 and17.29. Therefore, these are valid solutions.\n\nBut then, if we continue this pattern, for each k, Case 2 continues to have solutions, leading to infinitely many intersection points. But the problem states finitely many. Therefore, there must be a mistake in our analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps the original problem has a typo, or perhaps I misread it. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: \"The parabola x=34y² intersects the graph of f(x) at finitely many points.\" But according to our analysis, there are infinitely many intersection points. This contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, there must be an error in our approach.",
    "Wait, perhaps the function f(x) is defined differently. Let me check:\n\n\"A piecewise linear periodic function is defined by f(x)=begin{cases}x&text{if }x∈[-1,1)\\2 -x&text{if }x∈[1,3)end{cases} and f(x+4)=f(x) for all real numbers x.\"\n\nYes, that's correct. So f(x) is a sawtooth function with period 4, going from -1 to 1 with slope 1, then from 1 to -1 with slope -1 over the next 2 units, then repeating.\n\nThe parabola x=34y² is a standard right-opening parabola. The intersection points would occur where x=34y² and y=f(x). Therefore, substituting y=f(x) into x=34y² gives x=34[f(x)]². Since f(x) is periodic, this equation must be solved over each period.\n\nBut since x=34[f(x)]² must lie within the same period as x. However, x=34[f(x)]² can be much larger than the period, leading to solutions in higher periods. However, the problem states there are finitely many intersection points, which suggests that beyond a certain period, the equation x=34[f(x)]² has no solutions.\n\nBut why?\n\nLet's analyze the equation x=34[f(x)]².\n\nSince f(x) is periodic with period 4, [f(x)]² is also periodic with period 4. Therefore, x=34[f(x)]² implies that x must be a multiple of 34 times a periodic function squared. However, x itself is not periodic, so this equation requires that x matches 34 times the square of its own periodic part.\n\nThis seems challenging, but perhaps there's a way to bound the solutions.\n\nNote that [f(x)]² ≤1, since f(x) ∈ (-1,1] for x ∈ [-1,3), and hence for all x due to periodicity. Therefore, x=34[f(x)]² ≤34*1=34. Therefore, x ≤34. Therefore, the intersection points can only occur where x ≤34. Therefore, x ∈ [0,34]. Therefore, k such that 4k -1 ≤34. So 4k ≤35 →k ≤8.75. Therefore, k=0,1,2,...,8. Therefore, finite number of periods. Therefore, finitely many intersection points.\n\nAh! This is the key point. Since [f(x)]² ≤1, because f(x) is between -1 and 1 (excluding -1 and including 1). Therefore, x=34[f(x)]² ≤34*1=34. Therefore, x must be ≤34. Therefore, the intersections can only occur where x ≤34. Therefore, x ∈ [0,34]. Therefore, the possible k's are from k=0 up to k=8, since 4*8 +3=35, which is greater than34. Therefore, k=0 to k=8.\n\nBut wait, x=34[f(x)]² ≤34, so x ≤34. Therefore, x ∈ [0,34]. Therefore, the periods intersected are k=0 (x ∈ [0,3)), k=1 (x ∈ [3,7)),..., up to k=8 (x ∈ [31,35)). But x=34 is in k=8's interval [31,35). Therefore, total k=0 to k=8.\n\nTherefore, there are 9 periods to consider. For each k=0 to8, solve the quadratic equations in Case 1 and Case 2, check if solutions lie within the respective intervals, and sum the y-coordinates.\n\nHowever, this would be time-consuming, but since the sum for each k cancels out to zero (as observed earlier), except for k=0 where there's a solution at x=0 (y=0) which doesn't have a corresponding negative pair, but in reality, for k=0, we have y=0, y=1/34, y=(-1 +√273)/68, and y=(-1 -√273)/68. Summing these gives zero as shown earlier.",
    "Wait, but if for each k from0 to8, the sum of y-coordinates cancels to zero, then the total sum would be zero. But the problem states the sum can be expressed in the form (a +b√c)/d. Therefore, this suggests that our earlier conclusion is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that when considering all k, the sum cancels, but due to x ≤34, some periods do not contribute solutions. For example, when k=8, x ∈ [31,35). But x=34y² ≤34, so x ∈ [31,34]. Therefore, solving for k=8:\n\nCase 1: x ∈ [31,33). f(x)=x -32.

Therefore, our analysis must be missing something.",
    "Wait, going back to k=0:\n\nSolutions:\n\ny=0, y=1/34, y=(-1 ±√273)/68.\n\nSum=0 +1/34 + [(-1 +√273)/68 + (-1 -√273)/68]=0 +1/34 + (-2)/68=0 +1/34 -1/34=0.\n\nBut the problem says \"the sum of the y-coordinates of these intersection points can be expressed in the form...\", which implies the sum is not zero. Therefore, contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in our approach. Let's re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the sum of the y-coordinates of these intersection points\". If the intersections are symmetric about the x-axis, positive and negative y's would cancel. However, f(x) is not symmetric about the x-axis. Wait, f(x) is an odd function?\n\nWait, f(x) defined on [-1,1) as x, and on [1,3) as 2 -x. Let's check symmetry:\n\nFor x in [-1,1), f(-x)=-x=-f(x).\n\nFor x in [1,3), let's take x=2 +t where t ∈ [-1,1). Then f(x)=2 -x=2 -(2 +t)=-t=-f(-x). Because f(-x)=f(-(2 +t))=f(-2 -t +4)=f(2 -t)=2 -(2 -t)=t. Therefore, f(-x)=t=-f(x). Therefore, f(-x)=-f(x). Therefore, f(x) is an odd function.\n\nTherefore, the graph of f(x) is symmetric about the origin. Therefore, if (x,y) is an intersection point, then (-x,-y) is also an intersection point. However, since x=34y² is always non-negative, x ≥0. Therefore, for every intersection point (x,y) with y>0, there is a corresponding point (x,-y) only if x=34(-y)^2=34y²=x. But y=f(x), and since f(x) is odd, if y=f(x), then -y=f(-x). But x=34y² implies -x=34(-y)^2=34y², which would imply x=0. Therefore, except for x=0, there are no symmetric points. Therefore, only the point (0,0) is self-symmetric. All other points have x>0 and y determined by f(x). Since f(x) is odd, but x is non-negative, there's no symmetry to cancel y-coordinates. Therefore, our earlier conclusion that the sum is zero is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, there's a mistake in assuming symmetry. Let's re-express the problem.\n\nGiven x=34y² and y=f(x), and f(x) is odd, but x ≥0. Therefore, all intersection points must have x ≥0 and y=f(x). Since f(x) is odd, for x>0, y=f(x) can be positive or negative. However, x=34y² implies that if y is negative, x is still positive. Therefore, each solution y corresponds to x=34y². Therefore, the sum of y-coordinates is the sum of all real solutions y of y=f(34y²).\n\nBut since f is periodic, f(34y²)=f(34y² mod4). Let's denote z=34y² mod4. Then f(z)=y.\n\nBut 34y² mod4= (34 mod4)y² mod4=2y² mod4.\n\nTherefore, z=2y² mod4, and y=f(z).\n\nBut z ∈ [-1,3). However, z=2y² mod4. Since 2y² is always non-negative, z=2y² -4k for some integer k ≥0 such that z ∈ [-1,3).\n\nTherefore, z=2y² -4k ∈ [-1,3). Therefore, 2y² -4k ≥-1 and 2y² -4k <3.\n\nRearranged:\n\n4k -1 ≤2y² <4k +3.\n\nTherefore, y² ∈ [ (4k -1)/2, (4k +3)/2 ).\n\nBut y² ≥0, so (4k -1)/2 ≥0 →k ≥1/4. Since k is integer, k ≥0.\n\nTherefore, for each k ≥0, y² ∈ [max(0, (4k -1)/2), (4k +3)/2).\n\nBut y=f(z)=f(2y² -4k).\n\nDepending on z=2y² -4k:\n\nIf z ∈ [-1,1), then f(z)=z=2y² -4k.\n\nIf z ∈ [1,3), then f(z)=2 -z=2 - (2y² -4k)=2 -2y² +4k.\n\nTherefore, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: z ∈ [-1,1) →2y² -4k ∈ [-1,1).\n\nThus:\n\n-1 ≤2y² -4k <1 →4k -1 ≤2y² <4k +1.\n\nThen y=f(z)=2y² -4k.\n\nTherefore, y=2y² -4k →2y² -y -4k=0.\n\nCase 2: z ∈ [1,3) →2y² -4k ∈ [1,3).\n\nThus:\n\n1 ≤2y² -4k <3 →4k +1 ≤2y² <4k +3.\n\nThen y=f(z)=2 - (2y² -4k)=2 -2y² +4k.\n\nTherefore, y=2 -2y² +4k →2y² +y - (4k +2)=0.\n\nTherefore, for each k ≥0, we have two quadratic equations:\n\nCase 1:2y² -y -4k=0, with y² ∈ [ (4k -1)/2, (4k +1)/2 )\n\nCase 2:2y² +y - (4k +2)=0, with y² ∈ [ (4k +1)/2, (4k +3)/2 )\n\nWe need to solve these equations for y and check if y² lies in the respective intervals.\n\nLet's analyze Case 1:\n\nEquation:2y² -y -4k=0.\n\nSolutions:\n\ny=[1 ±√(1 +32k)]/4.\n\nSince y² must be ≥(4k -1)/2 and <(4k +1)/2.\n\nSimilarly, Case 2:\n\nEquation:2y² +y - (4k +2)=0.\n\nSolutions:\n\ny=[-1 ±√(1 +32k +16)]/4=[-1 ±√(32k +17)]/4.\n\nAnd y² must be ≥(4k +1)/2 and <(4k +3)/2.\n\nBut this approach seems complicated. However, since the problem states finitely many solutions, there must be a maximum k for which these equations have real solutions.\n\nLet's find the maximum k such that Case 1 or Case 2 has real solutions.\n\nFor Case 1:\n\nDiscriminant=1 +32k ≥0 →k ≥0.\n\nBut y² must be ≥(4k -1)/2 and <(4k +1)/2.\n\nSimilarly, for Case 2:\n\nDiscriminant=1 +32k +16=32k +17 ≥0 →k ≥0.\n\nBut y² must be ≥(4k +1)/2 and <(4k +3)/2.\n\nLet's find k such that solutions exist.\n\nFor Case 1:\n\ny=[1 ±√(1 +32k)]/4.\n\nCompute y²:\n\ny²=[1 ±2√(1 +32k) +1 +32k]/16=[2 ±2√(1 +32k) +32k]/16=[1 ±√(1 +32k) +16k]/8.\n\nThis must lie in [(4k -1)/2, (4k +1)/2).\n\nSimilarly, for Case 2:\n\ny=[-1 ±√(32k +17)]/4.\n\nCompute y²:\n\ny²=[1 ±2√(32k +17) +32k +17]/16=[18 ±2√(32k +17) +32k]/16=[9 ±√(32k +17) +16k]/8.\n\nThis must lie in [(4k +1)/2, (4k +3)/2).\n\nThis seems very involved. However, given the problem's answer format, it's likely that only k=0 contributes to the sum, and higher k's either have no solutions or their contributions cancel out. But earlier analysis showed that for k=0, the sum is zero, which contradicts the problem's answer format.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers only the principal period [-1,3), but since x=34y² is non-negative, intersections occur in [0,3).

Valid.\n\nCase 2 (k=0):\n\ny=2 -2y² +0 →2y² +y -2=0.\n\nSolutions:\n\ny=(-1 ±√(1 +16))/4=(-1 ±√17)/4.\n\nCheck y² ∈ [0.5,1):\n\nFor y=(-1 +√17)/4≈(-1 +4.123)/4≈3.123/4≈0.781. y²≈0.61 ∈ [0.5,1). Valid.\n\nFor y=(-1 -√17)/4≈(-1 -4.123)/4≈-5.123/4≈-1.28. But y ∈ (-1,1]. Invalid.\n\nTherefore, valid solutions are y=0, y=1/2, y=(-1 +√17)/4.\n\nSum of y-coordinates:0 +1/2 +(-1 +√17)/4= (0) + (2/4) + (-1 +√17)/4= (2 -1 +√17)/4= (1 +√17)/4.\n\nExpressed as (1 +√17)/4. Therefore, a=1, b=1, c=17, d=4. These are coprime, and 17 is square-free.\n\nTherefore, a+b+c+d=1+1+17+4=23.",
    "But wait, according to this analysis, the sum is (1 +√17)/4, which is different from our previous conclusion. This suggests that earlier analysis was incorrect due to not properly considering the periodicity and the constraints on y.",
    "Let's verify this:\n\nCase 1 (k=0):\n\ny=2y² →y=0 or y=1/2.\n\nCase 2 (k=0):\n\ny=2 -2y² →2y² +y -2=0 →y=(-1 ±√17)/4. Only positive solution is y=(-1 +√17)/4≈0.781.\n\nTherefore, intersection points:\n\n(0,0), (34*(1/2)^2,1/2)=(34*(1/4),1/2)=(8.5,1/2), and (34*((-1 +√17)/4)^2, (-1 +√17)/4).\n\nCalculate x for the third point:\n\n34*((-1 +√17)/4)^2=34*(1 -2√17 +17)/16=34*(18 -2√17)/16=34*(9 -√17)/8= (306 -34√17)/8=153/4 -17√17/4.\n\nBut y=(-1 +√17)/4.\n\nTherefore, three intersection points:\n\n(0,0), (8.5,0.5), and (153/4 -17√17/4, (-1 +√17)/4).\n\nSum of y-coordinates:0 +0.5 +(-1 +√17)/4=0.5 +(-1 +√17)/4= (2/4 -1/4 +√17/4)= (1 +√17)/4.\n\nTherefore, the sum is (1 +√17)/4, so a=1, b=1, c=17, d=4. Therefore, a+b+c+d=1+1+17+4=23.\n\nThis matches the problem's required format. Therefore, the correct answer is 23.\n"
