Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, 25/11 is approximately 2.2727, 11/25 is 0.44, subtracting 1 gives 25/11 + 11/25 - 1 = (25/11 - 1) + 11/25 = (14/11) + 11/25. Let me convert these to fractions:\n\n14/11 is 14/11, 11/25 is 11/25. To add them, find a common denominator. 11 and 25 are coprime, so LCD is 275.\n\n14/11 = (14*25)/275 = 350/275\n\n11/25 = (11*11)/275 = 121/275\n\nSo adding them: 350 + 121 = 471, so 471/275. Then multiply by 1/3: (471/275)*(1/3) = 471/825. Simplify 471/825. Let's see if they have a common factor. 471 ÷ 3 = 157, 825 ÷ 3 = 275. So x₂ = 157/275.\n\nOkay, x₂ = 157/275. Now compute x₃ = (1/3)(157/275 + 1/(157/275) - 1). Let's compute each part:\n\nFirst term: 157/275\n\nSecond term: 1/(157/275) = 275/157\n\nThird term: -1\n\nSo x₃ = (1/3)(157/275 + 275/157 - 1). Let's compute inside the parentheses:\n\nCompute 157/275 + 275/157. Let's find a common denominator here as well. The denominators are 275 and 157. Since 275 = 25*11, 157 is prime? Let me check: 157 ÷ 2 no, 3? 1+5+7=13, not divisible by 3. 5? Ends with 7. 7? 157/7 ≈ 22.428... Not integer. 11? 157/11 ≈14.27. So yes, 157 is prime. So LCD is 275*157.\n\nCompute numerator:",

Then 19033 ÷ 5109 = 3*5109=15327, 19033 -15327=3706. GCD(5109,3706). 5109 ÷ 3706=1, remainder 1403. GCD(3706,1403). 3706 ÷1403=2*1403=2806, remainder 900. GCD(1403,900). 1403 ÷900=1, remainder 503. GCD(900,503). 900 ÷503=1, remainder 397. GCD(503,397). 503 ÷397=1, remainder 106. GCD(397,106). 397 ÷106=3*106=318, remainder 79. GCD(106,79). 106 ÷79=1, remainder27. GCD(79,27). 79 ÷27=2*27=54, remainder25. GCD(27,25). 27 ÷25=1, remainder2. GCD(25,2). 25 ÷2=12, remainder1. GCD(2,1). So GCD is 1. Therefore, 19033/43175 is reduced.

Let's compute GCD(388,575, 171,297). 388,575 -2*171,297=388,575 -342,594=45,981. GCD(171,297,45,981). 171,297 ÷45,981=3*45,981=137,943; remainder=171,297 -137,943=33,354.

So earlier mistake was in computing a₃ as 513,816 instead of 513,891. So that explains the discrepancy. So x₃=19,033/43,175.\n\nTherefore, the sequences a_k and b_k correctly generate the reduced fractions.

So actually, GCD of a₃ and b₃ is 27. Therefore, the reduced fraction is 19,033/43,175.",

However, since we know that GCD(a₃,b₃)=27, we can factor that out.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a multiplicative pattern here. Since each time, the GCD seems to be 3^{k-1}. For k=1, GCD=1=3⁰. For k=2, GCD=3¹. For k=3, GCD=3². Maybe for k=4, GCD=3³, and so on. If that's the case, then when we reduce x_k = a_k / b_k, we divide numerator and denominator by 3^{k-1}. Therefore, the reduced numerator and denominator would be a_k /3^{k-1} and b_k /3^{k-1}. Let's verify:\n\nFor k=2: a₂=471, b₂=825. Divide by 3¹=3: 471/3=157, 825/3=275. Which matches x₂=157/275.\n\nFor k=3: a₃=513,891, b₃=1,165,725. Divide by 3²=9: 513,891/9=57,099 (Wait, 513,891 ÷9: 9*57,000=513,000; 513,891 -513,000=891; 891 ÷9=99. So total 57,099. Similarly, 1,165,725 ÷9=129,525. Then x₃=57,099/129,525. But earlier we found x₃=19,033/43,175. Wait, but 57,099/129,525 simplifies further. Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 57,099 ÷3=19,033; 129,525 ÷3=43,175. So GCD(a₃/9, b₃/9)=3. So GCD(a₃,b₃)=9*3=27, which matches. So GCD(a₃,b₃)=3²*3=3³? Wait, no:\n\nWait, GCD(a₃,b₃)=27=3³. Then GCD(a₃/3²,b₃/3²)=3. So GCD(a₃,b₃)=3³.\n\nSimilarly, GCD(a₂,b₂)=3¹, GCD(a₁,b₁)=3⁰=1.\n\nSo seems like GCD(a_k,b_k)=3^{k-1}. Therefore, when reducing x_k = a_k / b_k, we divide numerator and denominator by 3^{k-1}, resulting in coprime numbers. Therefore, the reduced numerator m_k = a_k / 3^{k-1}, reduced denominator n_k = b_k / 3^{k-1}. And m_k and n_k are coprime.\n\nTherefore, if we can find a recurrence relation for m_k and n_k, which are coprime, then perhaps we can find a pattern.\n\nGiven that:\n\na_{k+1} = a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k\n\nb_{k+1} = 3 a_k b_k\n\nBut since GCD(a_k,b_k)=3^{k-1}, let me write a_k = 3^{k-1} m_k, b_k =3^{k-1} n_k, where GCD(m_k,n_k)=1.\n\nThen:\n\na_{k+1} = (3^{k-1} m_k)² + (3^{k-1} n_k)² - (3^{k-1} m_k)(3^{k-1} n_k)\n\n= 3^{2(k-1)} m_k² + 3^{2(k-1)} n_k² - 3^{2(k-1)} m_k n_k\n\n= 3^{2(k-1)} (m_k² + n_k² - m_k n_k )\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb_{k+1} =3*(3^{k-1} m_k)*(3^{k-1} n_k )=3^{1 +2(k-1)} m_k n_k=3^{2k -1} m_k n_k\n\nTherefore,\n\na_{k+1} =3^{2(k-1)} (m_k² +n_k² -m_k n_k )\n\nb_{k+1}=3^{2k -1} m_k n_k\n\nBut since GCD(a_{k+1},b_{k+1})=3^{k}, we can write:\n\na_{k+1} =3^{k} m_{k+1}\n\nb_{k+1}=3^{k} n_{k+1}\n\nTherefore,\n\n3^{k} m_{k+1}=3^{2(k-1)} (m_k² +n_k² -m_k n_k )\n\nDivide both sides by 3^{k}:\n\nm_{k+1}=3^{2(k-1)-k} (m_k² +n_k² -m_k n_k )=3^{k -2} (m_k² +n_k² -m_k n_k )\n\nSimilarly,\n\n3^{k} n_{k+1}=3^{2k -1} m_k n_k\n\nDivide both sides by 3^{k}:\n\nn_{k+1}=3^{2k -1 -k} m_k n_k=3^{k -1} m_k n_k\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\nm_{k+1}=3^{k -2} (m_k² +n_k² -m_k n_k )\n\nn_{k+1}=3^{k -1} m_k n_k\n\nBut this seems complicated.

Then:\n\ns_{k+1} = (s_k)/3 +3/s_k -1\n\nSo s_{k+1} = (s_k)/3 +3/s_k -1\n\nWhich is similar to the original recurrence but with coefficients changed. Original recurrence was x_{k+1} = (x_k +1/x_k -1)/3. So s_k follows a similar recurrence but with an extra term.\n\nThis doesn't seem to help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that the sequence converges to 1/2, as earlier fixed point analysis suggested. Then for large k, x_k ≈1/2 +ε_k, where ε_k is small. Let's perform a Taylor expansion around 1/2.\n\nLet x_k =1/2 +ε_k. Then 1/x_k ≈2 -4ε_k +8ε_k² -... (using the expansion 1/(1/2 +ε) =2/(1 +2ε) ≈2(1 -2ε +4ε² -...))\n\nSo substituting into the recurrence:\n\nx_{k+1} ≈(1/3)(1/2 +ε_k +2 -4ε_k +8ε_k² -1 )\n\nSimplify inside:\n\n1/2 +ε_k +2 -4ε_k +8ε_k² -1 = (1/2 +2 -1) + (ε_k -4ε_k) +8ε_k² = 3/2 -3ε_k +8ε_k²\n\nThus x_{k+1}≈(1/3)(3/2 -3ε_k +8ε_k²)=1/2 -ε_k + (8/3)ε_k²\n\nBut x_{k+1}=1/2 +ε_{k+1}, so:\n\n1/2 +ε_{k+1}≈1/2 -ε_k + (8/3)ε_k²\n\nTherefore, ε_{k+1}≈-ε_k + (8/3)ε_k²\n\nFor small ε_k, the term (8/3)ε_k² is negligible compared to -ε_k. So approximately, ε_{k+1}≈-ε_k, suggesting that the error alternates sign and decreases in magnitude if |ε_{k+1}| < |ε_k|. However, the coefficient here is -1, so ε_{k+1}≈-ε_k, implying that the error alternates but doesn't decay, which contradicts the convergence. Therefore, the linear term suggests that the error alternates but doesn't decay, but the quadratic term might affect the long-term behavior. However, this is only a heuristic argument. In reality, the behavior might be more complex.\n\nGiven that manual computation shows that x₁=25/11≈2.2727, x₂≈0.571, x₃≈0.440, x₄ would be... Let's compute x₄ using x₃=19,033/43,175≈0.440.\n\nCompute x₄=(1/3)(19,033/43,175 +43,175/19,033 -1)\n\nFirst, compute 43,175/19,033≈2.268. So:\n\n19,033/43,175≈0.440 +2.268≈2.708 -1≈1.708. Multiply by 1/3≈0.569. So x₄≈0.569. Then x₅ would be (1/3)(0.569 +1/0.569 -1). Compute 1/0.569≈1.757. So 0.569 +1.757≈2.326 -1≈1.326. Multiply by 1/3≈0.442. So x₅≈0.442. Then x₆≈(1/3)(0.442 +1/0.442 -1). Compute 1/0.442≈2.262. So 0.442 +2.262≈2.704 -1≈1.704. Multiply by 1/3≈0.568. So x₆≈0.568. So it seems like the sequence is oscillating around 0.5, getting closer each time? From x₃≈0.440, x₄≈0.569, x₅≈0.442, x₆≈0.568, x₇≈0.443, etc., converging towards 0.5. But since the problem asks for x_{2025}, which is odd, 2025=2*1012 +1, so if the sequence alternates between ~0.44 and ~0.56, converging slowly, then x_{2025} would be on the lower side. But this is just approximate. However, the problem states that x_{2025} can be expressed as m/n with m and n coprime, so it must be a precise fraction. Given the earlier terms, the fractions are getting more complex, so likely there's a pattern or a linear recurrence that can be solved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recurrence can be transformed into a linear recurrence through substitution. Let's consider the following idea:\n\nSuppose we let y_k = x_k -1/2. Then substituting into the recurrence:\n\nx_{k+1} = (1/3)(x_k +1/x_k -1)\n\nExpress in terms of y_k:\n\nx_{k+1} = (1/3)( (1/2 + y_k) +1/(1/2 + y_k) -1 )\n\nSimplify 1/(1/2 + y_k):\n\n= 1/(1/2 + y_k) = 2/(1 + 2y_k) ≈2(1 -2y_k +4y_k² -8y_k³ +...) using the expansion 1/(1 +t) ≈1 -t +t² -t³ +... for small t.\n\nAssuming y_k is small (since converging to 1/2), then:\n\nx_{k+1} ≈(1/3)(1/2 + y_k +2(1 -2y_k +4y_k²) -1 )\n\nCompute inside:\n\n1/2 + y_k +2 -4y_k +8y_k² -1 = (1/2 +2 -1) + (y_k -4y_k) +8y_k² = 3/2 -3y_k +8y_k²\n\nMultiply by 1/3:\n\nx_{k+1}≈1/2 -y_k + (8/3)y_k²\n\nBut x_{k+1}=1/2 +y_{k+1}, so:\n\n1/2 +y_{k+1}≈1/2 -y_k + (8/3)y_k²\n\nTherefore, y_{k+1}≈-y_k + (8/3)y_k²\n\nThis suggests that for small y_k, the error term y_{k+1} ≈-y_k, leading to oscillations. However, the quadratic term may cause the amplitude to decrease if y_k is positive or negative. However, this is a heuristic approximation and may not hold for larger y_k.",

Thus RHS= -150,926/(157*275), same as LHS. So equality holds for n=2.\n\nTherefore, the telescoping sum works for n=1,2. So general formula:\n\nSum_{k=1}^n [1/x_k -2x_k] =3x_{n+1} -3x₁ +n\n\nThis seems promising. However, how can we use this to find x_{n}?\n\nIf we can compute the sum on the left-hand side, we could solve for x_{n+1}.

For example, if after some k, x_{k}≡x_{k+1} mod something, but this is speculative.\n\nGiven the time I've spent without progress, I think I need to consider that this problem might require an insight that I'm missing. Let me revisit the original recurrence:\n\nx_{k+1} = (x_k +1/x_k -1)/3\n\nLet me consider writing this as:\n\n3x_{k+1} +1 =x_k +1/x_k\n\nLet me denote u_k =x_k +1/x_k, then:\n\n3x_{k+1} +1 =u_k\n\nAlso, note that u_{k+1}=x_{k+1} +1/x_{k+1}\n\nBut from the first equation, u_k=3x_{k+1} +1. Therefore:\n\nu_{k+1}=x_{k+1} +1/x_{k+1}= (u_k -1)/3 +3/(u_k -1)\n\nThis gives:\n\nu_{k+1}= (u_k -1)/3 +3/(u_k -1)\n\nLet me denote v_k=u_k -2. Then:\n\nu_k= v_k +2\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nu_{k+1}= (v_k +2 -1)/3 +3/(v_k +2 -1)= (v_k +1)/3 +3/(v_k +1)\n\nThus:\n\nu_{k+1}= (v_k +1)/3 +3/(v_k +1)\n\nBut u_{k+1}=v_{k+1} +2, so:\n\nv_{k+1} +2= (v_k +1)/3 +3/(v_k +1)\n\nRearranged:\n\nv_{k+1}= (v_k +1)/3 +3/(v_k +1) -2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (v_k +1)/3 -2 +3/(v_k +1)\n\n= (v_k +1 -6)/3 +3/(v_k +1)\n\n= (v_k -5)/3 +3/(v_k +1)\n\nThis still looks complicated. Let me compute the first few terms of v_k:\n\nu₁=x₁ +1/x₁=25/11 +11/25=746/275≈2.7127. Thus v₁=u₁ -2≈0.7127\n\nCompute u₂=(v₁ +1)/3 +3/(v₁ +1)= (1.7127)/3 +3/1.7127≈0.5709 +1.751≈2.3219. Thus v₂≈0.3219\n\nSimilarly, u₃=(v₂ +1)/3 +3/(v₂ +1)= (1.3219)/3 +3/1.3219≈0.4406 +2.268≈2.7086. Thus v₃≈0.7086\n\nu₄=(v₃ +1)/3 +3/(v₃ +1)=1.7086/3 +3/1.7086≈0.5695 +1.754≈2.3235. Thus v₄≈0.3235\n\nu₅=(v₄ +1)/3 +3/(v₄ +1)=1.3235/3 +3/1.3235≈0.4412 +2.267≈2.7082. Thus v₅≈0.7082\n\nObserving that v_k oscillates between approximately0.708 and0.323, getting closer each time. This suggests that the sequence u_k is converging to a fixed point. Let's solve for the fixed point v where v= (v +1)/3 +3/(v +1) -2\n\nLet me set v= (v +1)/3 +3/(v +1) -2\n\nMultiply both sides by3(v +1):\n\n3(v +1)v= (v +1)^2 +9 -6(v +1)\n\nExpand:\n\n3v² +3v= v² +2v +1 +9 -6v -6\n\nSimplify right-hand side:\n\nv² +2v +1 +9 -6v -6= v² -4v +4\n\nThus:\n\n3v² +3v= v² -4v +4\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n2v² +7v -4=0\n\nSolve:\n\nv=(-7 ±sqrt(49 +32))/4=(-7 ±sqrt(81))/4=(-7 ±9)/4\n\nPositive solution: (2)/4=0.5\n\nNegative solution: (-16)/4=-4\n\nSince v represents u -2 and u=x +1/x ≥2 (by AM ≥GM), v≥0. Thus the fixed point is v=0.5. Therefore, the sequence v_k converges to0.5, so u_k converges to2.5, and x_k converges to0.5 or2. But since the sequence alternates around0.5, it converges to0.5.\n\nHowever, convergence doesn't help us find the exact value at2025. Given the time invested and lack of progress, I think the answer is likely converges to1/2, but since it's a fraction, perhaps after sufficiently many steps, the terms become1/2. However, starting from25/11, which is not1/2, and applying rational operations, it's impossible to reach1/2 exactly.

Let's check with computed terms:\n\nx₁=25/11≈2.2727\n\nx₂=157/275≈0.5709\n\nx₃=19,033/43,175≈0.440\n\nx₄≈0.569\n\nx₅≈0.442\n\nx₆≈0.568\n\nx₇≈0.443\n\nx₈≈0.568\n\nWait, this suggests that after x₃, the sequence oscillates between approximately0.44 and0.57, but not exact period-2. However, if there's an exact period-2 cycle, then x_{k+2}=x_k. Let's test this.\n\nAssume x_{k+2}=x_k. Then:\n\nx_{k+1}= (x_k +1/x_k -1)/3\n\nx_{k+2}= (x_{k+1} +1/x_{k+1} -1)/3= x_k\n\nThus:\n\nx_k= (x_{k+1} +1/x_{k+1} -1)/3\n\nBut x_{k+1}= (x_k +1/x_k -1)/3. Substitute:\n\nx_k= [ (x_k +1/x_k -1)/3 +3/(x_k +1/x_k -1) -1 ] /3\n\nThis equation must hold for x_k in the cycle. Let's assume x_k=a and x_{k+1}=b. Then:\n\na= (b +1/b -1)/3\n\nb= (a +1/a -1)/3\n\nThis system of equations:\n\nFrom first equation:3a =b +1/b -1\n\nFrom second equation:3b =a +1/a -1\n\nLet's solve this system.\n\nFrom first equation:1/b=3a +1 -b\n\nSubstitute into second equation:\n\n3b =a +1/a -1\n\nBut1/a from first equation:1/a=3b +1 -a\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's substitute one equation into the other.\n\nFrom first equation:3a =b +1/b -1 → 3a +1 =b +1/b\n\nFrom second equation:3b +1 =a +1/a\n\nSo we have:\n\n3a +1 =b +1/b ...(1)\n\n3b +1 =a +1/a ...(2)\n\nLet me denote p=a +1/a and q=b +1/b. Then:\n\nFrom equation (1):3a +1 = q\n\nFrom equation (2):3b +1 = p\n\nAlso, note that p= a +1/a and q= b +1/b.\n\nBut from equation (1): q=3a +1\n\nFrom equation (2): p=3b +1\n\nBut p= a +1/a and q= b +1/b. So:\n\na +1/a=3b +1 ...(3)\n\nb +1/b=3a +1 ...(4)\n\nLet me subtract equations (3) and (4):\n\n(a +1/a) - (b +1/b)=3b +1 -3a -1\n\nSimplify:\n\na -b +1/a -1/b=3b -3a\n\nMultiply both sides byab to eliminate denominators:\n\nab(a -b) +b -a=3b*ab -3a*ab\n\nSimplify:\n\na²b -ab² +b -a=3ab² -3a²b\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\na²b -ab² +b -a -3ab² +3a²b=0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(1+3)a²b + (-1-3)ab² +b -a=0\n\n4a²b -4ab² +b -a=0\n\nFactor:\n\n4ab(a -b) + (b -a)=0\n\nFactor out (a -b):\n\n(a -b)(4ab -1)=0\n\nThus, either a=b or4ab -1=0.\n\nCase1:a=b. Then from equation (3):a +1/a=3a +1 →1/a=2a +1 →2a² +a -1=0. Solutions:a=(-1 ±sqrt(1 +8))/4=(-1 ±3)/4. Thus a=1/2 or a=-1. Since x_k is positive, a=1/2. Thus the fixed point.\n\nCase2:4ab -1=0 →ab=1/4.\n\nFrom equation (3):a +1/a=3b +1\n\nFrom equation (4):b +1/b=3a +1\n\nSinceab=1/4, then b=1/(4a). Substitute into equation (3):\n\na +1/a=3*(1/(4a)) +1 →a +1/a=3/(4a) +1\n\nMultiply both sides by4a:\n\n4a² +4=3 +4a\n\n→4a² -4a +1=0\n\nDiscriminant:16 -16=0 →a=(4)/8=0.5\n\nThus a=0.5, then b=1/(4*0.5)=0.5. Thus this reduces to Case1.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is a=b=1/2. Thus the cycle assumption leads back to the fixed point, implying no nontrivial cycles. Therefore, the sequence converges to1/2 but doesn't cycle.\n\nGiven this, and since the problem asks for x_{2025}, which is very large, perhaps x_{2025} is very close to1/2, but since it must be a fraction, the numerator and denominator are such that m/n≈1/2 with m and n coprime.

    "\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find x_{2025} in this sequence defined recursively, and then find m + n mod 1000 where m/n is the reduced form. The starting point is x₁ = 25/11, and each subsequent term is given by x_{k+1} = (1/3)(x_k + 1/x_k - 1). Hmm, recursion can sometimes lead to patterns or cycles, or maybe it converges to a fixed point. Let me try to figure this out step by step.",
    "First, maybe compute the first few terms manually to see if there's a pattern. Let's start with x₁ = 25/11.\n\nCompute x₂: (1/3)(25/11 + 1/(25/11) - 1) = (1/3)(25/11 + 11/25 - 1). Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, 25/11 is approximately 2.2727, 11/25 is 0.44, subtracting 1 gives 25/11 + 11/25 - 1 = (25/11 - 1) + 11/25 = (14/11) + 11/25. Let me convert these to fractions:\n\n14/11 is 14/11, 11/25 is 11/25. To add them, find a common denominator. 11 and 25 are coprime, so LCD is 275.\n\n14/11 = (14*25)/275 = 350/275\n\n11/25 = (11*11)/275 = 121/275\n\nSo adding them: 350 + 121 = 471, so 471/275. Then multiply by 1/3: (471/275)*(1/3) = 471/825. Simplify 471/825. Let's see if they have a common factor. 471 ÷ 3 = 157, 825 ÷ 3 = 275. So x₂ = 157/275.\n\nOkay, x₂ = 157/275. Now compute x₃ = (1/3)(157/275 + 1/(157/275) - 1). Let's compute each part:\n\nFirst term: 157/275\n\nSecond term: 1/(157/275) = 275/157\n\nThird term: -1\n\nSo x₃ = (1/3)(157/275 + 275/157 - 1). Let's compute inside the parentheses:\n\nCompute 157/275 + 275/157. Let's find a common denominator here as well. The denominators are 275 and 157. Since 275 = 25*11, 157 is prime? Let me check: 157 ÷ 2 no, 3? 1+5+7=13, not divisible by 3. 5? Ends with 7. 7? 157/7 ≈ 22.428... Not integer. 11? 157/11 ≈14.27. So yes, 157 is prime. So LCD is 275*157.\n\nCompute numerator:",
    "157*157 + 275*275. Wait, no:\n\nWait, (157/275) + (275/157) = (157² + 275²)/(275*157)\n\nCompute numerator: 157² + 275²\n\n157²: 157*157. Let's compute 150² + 2*150*7 + 7² = 22500 + 2100 + 49 = 24649\n\n275²: 275*275. 200*200=40000, but wait, 275² = (200 + 75)² = 200² + 2*200*75 +75² = 40000 + 30000 + 5625 = 75625\n\nSo numerator: 24649 + 75625 = 100274\n\nDenominator: 275*157. Let's compute that. 275*150 = 41250, 275*7 = 1925, so total 41250 + 1925 = 43175\n\nSo (157/275 + 275/157) = 100274/43175\n\nThen subtract 1: 100274/43175 - 1 = (100274 - 43175)/43175 = 57099/43175\n\nThen multiply by 1/3: 57099/(43175*3) = 57099/129525\n\nSimplify 57099/129525. Let's check GCD of numerator and denominator.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3: 57099 ÷ 3 = 19033, 129525 ÷ 3 = 43175. Wait, 57099 ÷ 3: 3*19033 = 57099? Wait, 3*19000=57000, 3*33=99, so yes. So 19033/43175. Are these coprime? Let's check GCD(19033, 43175). Let's compute GCD(43175, 19033). 43175 ÷ 19033 = 2*19033 = 38066, 43175 - 38066 = 5109. So GCD(19033, 5109). Then 19033 ÷ 5109 = 3*5109=15327, 19033 -15327=3706. GCD(5109,3706). 5109 ÷ 3706=1, remainder 1403. GCD(3706,1403). 3706 ÷1403=2*1403=2806, remainder 900. GCD(1403,900). 1403 ÷900=1, remainder 503. GCD(900,503). 900 ÷503=1, remainder 397. GCD(503,397). 503 ÷397=1, remainder 106. GCD(397,106). 397 ÷106=3*106=318, remainder 79. GCD(106,79). 106 ÷79=1, remainder27. GCD(79,27). 79 ÷27=2*27=54, remainder25. GCD(27,25). 27 ÷25=1, remainder2. GCD(25,2). 25 ÷2=12, remainder1. GCD(2,1). So GCD is 1. Therefore, 19033/43175 is reduced. So x₃ = 19033/43175.\n\nHmm, this is getting messy. Maybe computing terms manually isn't the way to go here. The fractions are getting complicated. Let me think if there's a pattern or a recurrence relation that can be simplified.",
    "Alternatively, maybe this sequence converges to a fixed point. If it converges to L, then L = (1/3)(L + 1/L -1). Let's solve for L:\n\nMultiply both sides by 3: 3L = L + 1/L -1\n\nBring all terms to one side: 3L - L -1/L +1 =0 => 2L +1 -1/L =0\n\nMultiply by L to eliminate denominator: 2L² + L -1 =0\n\nQuadratic equation: 2L² + L -1 =0. Solutions: L = [-1 ± sqrt(1 +8)]/(4) = [-1 ±3]/4. So L = (-1 +3)/4 = 2/4 = 1/2 or L = (-1 -3)/4 = -1. But since all terms are positive (starting with 25/11, and each term is positive because if x_k is positive, then 1/x_k is positive, so x_{k+1} is positive), so the limit would be 1/2. So maybe the sequence converges to 1/2? But 2025 is a large number; maybe it's approaching 1/2. But the problem says to express x_{2025} as m/n, so maybe it's exactly 1/2? But wait, starting from 25/11, which is greater than 2, then x₂ is 157/275 ≈0.571, which is still greater than 1/2. Then x₃ is 19033/43175 ≈0.440, which is less than 1/2. Then x₄ would be... Maybe it alternates around 1/2? Hmm, but converges? Let's check.",
    "Wait, if the sequence converges to 1/2, then perhaps after many iterations, it gets very close. But since we need the exact fraction for x_{2025}, maybe the sequence has periodicity modulo something? Or perhaps the recursion can be linearized or transformed into a linear recurrence?",
    "Alternatively, maybe substituting y_k = 1/x_k -1? Let me see.

Then 1/x_k = y_k +1. Substitute into equation:\n\n3x_{k+1} = x_k + (y_k +1) -1 = x_k + y_k\n\nBut y_k = 1/x_k -1, so:\n\n3x_{k+1} = x_k + (1/x_k -1)",
    "Wait, that's just the original equation. Hmm, maybe not helpful.",
    "Alternatively, let's see if we can express x_{k+1} - 1/2 in terms of x_k -1/2. Maybe linearizing around the fixed point?\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose we let z_k = x_k - 1/2. Then perhaps express the recurrence in terms of z_k. But not sure.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps telescoping product or sum? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the recurrence relation:\n\n3x_{k+1} = x_k + 1/x_k -1\n\nMultiply both sides by x_k:\n\n3x_{k}x_{k+1} = x_k² +1 -x_k\n\nRearranged:\n\nx_k² -3x_kx_{k+1} -x_k +1 =0\n\nHmm, quadratic in x_k. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps define a new variable such that the recurrence becomes multiplicative. Let me see.\n\nSuppose we let x_k = a_k / b_k, where a_k and b_k are integers. Then maybe find a recurrence relation for a_k and b_k. But given that each step involves 1/x_k, which would invert the numerator and denominator. Let's try:\n\nGiven x_{k} = a_k / b_k, then 1/x_k = b_k / a_k.\n\nSo x_{k+1} = (1/3)(a_k/b_k + b_k/a_k -1)\n\nSo x_{k+1} = [ (a_k² + b_k² - a_k b_k ) / (3 a_k b_k ) ]\n\nSo x_{k+1} = (a_k² + b_k² - a_k b_k ) / (3 a_k b_k )\n\nTherefore, if we define a_{k+1} = a_k² + b_k² - a_k b_k\n\nand b_{k+1} = 3 a_k b_k\n\nThen x_{k+1} = a_{k+1} / b_{k+1}\n\nStarting with a₁ =25, b₁=11.\n\nSo maybe define sequences a_k and b_k:\n\na₁=25, b₁=11\n\na_{k+1} = a_k² + b_k² - a_k b_k\n\nb_{k+1} = 3 a_k b_k\n\nThen x_k = a_k / b_k\n\nSo perhaps computing a_{2025} and b_{2025} would give the numerator and denominator.

So a₃=513,891, b₃=3*471*825=3*471=1,413; 1,413*825.\n\nCompute 1,413*800=1,130,400; 1,413*25=35,325; total=1,130,400 +35,325=1,165,725. So b₃=1,165,725.\n\nThus x₃=513,891/1,165,725. Simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 3: 513,891 ÷3=171,297; 1,165,725 ÷3=388,575. Then check GCD(171,297, 388,575). Let's compute GCD(388,575, 171,297). 388,575 -2*171,297=388,575 -342,594=45,981. GCD(171,297,45,981). 171,297 ÷45,981=3*45,981=137,943; remainder=171,297 -137,943=33,354. GCD(45,981,33,354). 45,981 -33,354=12,627. GCD(33,354,12,627). 33,354 ÷12,627=2*12,627=25,254; remainder=33,354 -25,254=8,100. GCD(12,627,8,100). 12,627 -8,100=4,527. GCD(8,100,4,527). 8,100 ÷4,527=1*4,527=4,527; remainder=8,100 -4,527=3,573. GCD(4,527,3,573). 4,527 -3,573=954. GCD(3,573,954). 3,573 ÷954=3*954=2,862; remainder=3,573 -2,862=711. GCD(954,711). 954 -711=243. GCD(711,243). 711 ÷243=2*243=486; remainder=711 -486=225. GCD(243,225). 243 -225=18. GCD(225,18). 225 ÷18=12*18=216; remainder=9. GCD(18,9)=9. So GCD is 9. Therefore, divide numerator and denominator by 9: 171,297 ÷9=19,033; 388,575 ÷9=43,175. So x₃=19,033/43,175. Which matches the manual calculation. So earlier mistake was in computing a₃ as 513,816 instead of 513,891. So that explains the discrepancy. So x₃=19,033/43,175.\n\nTherefore, the sequences a_k and b_k correctly generate the reduced fractions. So starting with a₁=25, b₁=11:\n\na₂=471, b₂=825\n\na₃=513,891, b₃=1,165,725 → reduced to 19,033/43,175\n\nWait, but how? Because 513,891/1,165,725 reduces by dividing numerator and denominator by 27 (since 513,891 ÷27=19,033.0, and 1,165,725 ÷27=43,175.0). Wait, 27*19,033=513,891 and 27*43,175=1,165,725. So actually, GCD of a₃ and b₃ is 27. Therefore, the reduced fraction is 19,033/43,175.",
    "So seems like each step, a_{k} and b_{k} share a common factor which is 3^{k-1}? Let's check:\n\nAt k=1, a₁=25, b₁=11; GCD(25,11)=1.\n\nk=2, a₂=471, b₂=825. GCD(471,825). Let's compute GCD(825,471). 825 ÷471=1, remainder 354. GCD(471,354). 471 ÷354=1, remainder117. GCD(354,117). 354 ÷117=3, remainder 3. GCD(117,3). 117 ÷3=39, remainder 0. So GCD is 3. So a₂ and b₂ have GCD 3. Then x₂=471/825 reduces to 157/275 (divided by 3).\n\nk=3, a₃=513,891, b₃=1,165,725. GCD is 27, as shown earlier. So GCD(a₃,b₃)=27=3².\n\nk=4: Let's compute a₄ and b₄.\n\na₄= a₃² + b₃² -a₃b₃=513,891² +1,165,725² -513,891*1,165,725\n\nBut this is going to be a huge number. However, since we know that GCD(a₃,b₃)=27, we can factor that out.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a multiplicative pattern here. Since each time, the GCD seems to be 3^{k-1}. For k=1, GCD=1=3⁰. For k=2, GCD=3¹. For k=3, GCD=3². Maybe for k=4, GCD=3³, and so on. If that's the case, then when we reduce x_k = a_k / b_k, we divide numerator and denominator by 3^{k-1}. Therefore, the reduced numerator and denominator would be a_k /3^{k-1} and b_k /3^{k-1}. Let's verify:\n\nFor k=2: a₂=471, b₂=825. Divide by 3¹=3: 471/3=157, 825/3=275. Which matches x₂=157/275.\n\nFor k=3: a₃=513,891, b₃=1,165,725. Divide by 3²=9: 513,891/9=57,099 (Wait, 513,891 ÷9: 9*57,000=513,000; 513,891 -513,000=891; 891 ÷9=99. So total 57,099. Similarly, 1,165,725 ÷9=129,525. Then x₃=57,099/129,525. But earlier we found x₃=19,033/43,175. Wait, but 57,099/129,525 simplifies further. Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 57,099 ÷3=19,033; 129,525 ÷3=43,175. So GCD(a₃/9, b₃/9)=3. So GCD(a₃,b₃)=9*3=27, which matches. So GCD(a₃,b₃)=3²*3=3³? Wait, no:\n\nWait, GCD(a₃,b₃)=27=3³. Then GCD(a₃/3²,b₃/3²)=3. So GCD(a₃,b₃)=3³.\n\nSimilarly, GCD(a₂,b₂)=3¹, GCD(a₁,b₁)=3⁰=1.\n\nSo seems like GCD(a_k,b_k)=3^{k-1}. Therefore, when reducing x_k = a_k / b_k, we divide numerator and denominator by 3^{k-1}, resulting in coprime numbers. Therefore, the reduced numerator m_k = a_k / 3^{k-1}, reduced denominator n_k = b_k / 3^{k-1}. And m_k and n_k are coprime.\n\nTherefore, if we can find a recurrence relation for m_k and n_k, which are coprime, then perhaps we can find a pattern.\n\nGiven that:\n\na_{k+1} = a_k² + b_k² -a_k b_k\n\nb_{k+1} = 3 a_k b_k\n\nBut since GCD(a_k,b_k)=3^{k-1}, let me write a_k = 3^{k-1} m_k, b_k =3^{k-1} n_k, where GCD(m_k,n_k)=1.\n\nThen:\n\na_{k+1} = (3^{k-1} m_k)² + (3^{k-1} n_k)² - (3^{k-1} m_k)(3^{k-1} n_k)\n\n= 3^{2(k-1)} m_k² + 3^{2(k-1)} n_k² - 3^{2(k-1)} m_k n_k\n\n= 3^{2(k-1)} (m_k² + n_k² - m_k n_k )\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb_{k+1} =3*(3^{k-1} m_k)*(3^{k-1} n_k )=3^{1 +2(k-1)} m_k n_k=3^{2k -1} m_k n_k\n\nTherefore,\n\na_{k+1} =3^{2(k-1)} (m_k² +n_k² -m_k n_k )\n\nb_{k+1}=3^{2k -1} m_k n_k\n\nBut since GCD(a_{k+1},b_{k+1})=3^{k}, we can write:\n\na_{k+1} =3^{k} m_{k+1}\n\nb_{k+1}=3^{k} n_{k+1}\n\nTherefore,\n\n3^{k} m_{k+1}=3^{2(k-1)} (m_k² +n_k² -m_k n_k )\n\nDivide both sides by 3^{k}:\n\nm_{k+1}=3^{2(k-1)-k} (m_k² +n_k² -m_k n_k )=3^{k -2} (m_k² +n_k² -m_k n_k )\n\nSimilarly,\n\n3^{k} n_{k+1}=3^{2k -1} m_k n_k\n\nDivide both sides by 3^{k}:\n\nn_{k+1}=3^{2k -1 -k} m_k n_k=3^{k -1} m_k n_k\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\nm_{k+1}=3^{k -2} (m_k² +n_k² -m_k n_k )\n\nn_{k+1}=3^{k -1} m_k n_k\n\nBut this seems complicated.

However, the coefficient here is -1, so ε_{k+1}≈-ε_k, implying that the error alternates but doesn't decay, which contradicts the convergence. Therefore, the linear term suggests that the error alternates but doesn't decay, but the quadratic term might affect the long-term behavior. However, this is only a heuristic argument.

Multiply by 1/3≈0.569. So x₄≈0.569. Then x₅ would be (1/3)(0.569 +1/0.569 -1). Compute 1/0.569≈1.757. So 0.569 +1.757≈2.326 -1≈1.326. Multiply by 1/3≈0.442. So x₅≈0.442. Then x₆≈(1/3)(0.442 +1/0.442 -1). Compute 1/0.442≈2.262. So 0.442 +2.262≈2.704 -1≈1.704. Multiply by 1/3≈0.568. So x₆≈0.568. So it seems like the sequence is oscillating around 0.5, getting closer each time? From x₃≈0.440, x₄≈0.569, x₅≈0.442, x₆≈0.568, x₇≈0.443, etc., converging towards 0.5. But since the problem asks for x_{2025}, which is odd, 2025=2*1012 +1, so if the sequence alternates between ~0.44 and ~0.56, converging slowly, then x_{2025} would be on the lower side. But this is just approximate. However, the problem states that x_{2025} can be expressed as m/n with m and n coprime, so it must be a precise fraction. Given the earlier terms, the fractions are getting more complex, so likely there's a pattern or a linear recurrence that can be solved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recurrence can be transformed into a linear recurrence through substitution. Let's consider the following idea:\n\nSuppose we let y_k = x_k -1/2. Then substituting into the recurrence:\n\nx_{k+1} = (1/3)(x_k +1/x_k -1)\n\nExpress in terms of y_k:\n\nx_{k+1} = (1/3)( (1/2 + y_k) +1/(1/2 + y_k) -1 )\n\nSimplify 1/(1/2 + y_k):\n\n= 1/(1/2 + y_k) = 2/(1 + 2y_k) ≈2(1 -2y_k +4y_k² -8y_k³ +...) using the expansion 1/(1 +t) ≈1 -t +t² -t³ +... for small t.\n\nAssuming y_k is small (since converging to 1/2), then:\n\nx_{k+1} ≈(1/3)(1/2 + y_k +2(1 -2y_k +4y_k²) -1 )\n\nCompute inside:\n\n1/2 + y_k +2 -4y_k +8y_k² -1 = (1/2 +2 -1) + (y_k -4y_k) +8y_k² = 3/2 -3y_k +8y_k²\n\nMultiply by 1/3:\n\nx_{k+1}≈1/2 -y_k + (8/3)y_k²\n\nBut x_{k+1}=1/2 +y_{k+1}, so:\n\n1/2 +y_{k+1}≈1/2 -y_k + (8/3)y_k²\n\nTherefore, y_{k+1}≈-y_k + (8/3)y_k²\n\nThis suggests that for small y_k, the error term y_{k+1} ≈-y_k, leading to oscillations. However, the quadratic term may cause the amplitude to decrease if y_k is positive or negative. However, this is a heuristic approximation and may not hold for larger y_k.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps consider the substitution z_k =1/x_k -2. Let's see:\n\nIf x_k converges to1/2, then 1/x_k converges to2, so z_k converges to0.\n\nLet z_k =1/x_k -2. Then1/x_k =z_k +2. Substitute into the recurrence:\n\nx_{k+1}= (1/3)(x_k + z_k +2 -1 )= (1/3)(x_k + z_k +1 )\n\nAlso, z_{k+1}=1/x_{k+1} -2=3/(x_k + z_k +1 ) -2\n\nThis gives a system:\n\nx_{k+1}= (x_k + z_k +1 )/3\n\nz_{k+1}=3/(x_k + z_k +1 ) -2\n\nNot sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, express z_{k+1} in terms of z_k:\n\nFrom x_k =1/(z_k +2), substitute into z_{k+1}:\n\nz_{k+1}=3/( (1/(z_k +2)) + z_k +1 ) -2\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n1/(z_k +2) + z_k +1 = [1 + (z_k +1)(z_k +2)]/(z_k +2)\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n1 + (z_k +1)(z_k +2)=1 + z_k² +3z_k +2=z_k² +3z_k +3\n\nThus:\n\nz_{k+1}=3*(z_k +2)/(z_k² +3z_k +3) -2\n\n= [3(z_k +2) -2(z_k² +3z_k +3)]/(z_k² +3z_k +3)\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n3z_k +6 -2z_k² -6z_k -6= -2z_k² -3z_k\n\nThus:\n\nz_{k+1}= (-2z_k² -3z_k)/(z_k² +3z_k +3)\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps factor numerator:\n\n- z_k(2z_k +3)/denominator\n\nNot sure.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps this can be written as:\n\nz_{k+1}= -z_k(2z_k +3)/(z_k² +3z_k +3)\n\nThis recurrence relation might not have a straightforward solution. Given the complexity, perhaps this problem requires a different approach. Let's revisit the original recurrence:\n\nx_{k+1} = (x_k +1/x_k -1)/3\n\nLet me consider writing this as:\n\n3x_{k+1} +1 =x_k +1/x_k\n\nLet me denote u_k =x_k +1/x_k.

Then:\n\nu_{k+1}=v_k/3 +3/v_k\n\nSo:\n\nv_{k+1}=u_{k+1} -1= v_k/3 +3/v_k -1\n\nThis recurrence resembles the original one but for v_k. Not helpful.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps assume that v_{k+1}=f(v_k), but not sure.",
    "Alternatively, compute the first few terms of u_k:\n\nStarting with x₁=25/11, so u₁=25/11 +11/25= (625 +121)/275=746/275≈2.7127\n\nThen x₂=(u₁ -1)/3=(746/275 -275/275)/3=(471/275)/3=471/(275*3)=157/275≈0.5709\n\nThen u₂=x₂ +1/x₂=157/275 +275/157≈0.5709 +1.757≈2.3279\n\nSimilarly, x₃=(u₂ -1)/3=(2.3279 -1)/3≈1.3279/3≈0.4426\n\nThen u₃=x₃ +1/x₃≈0.4426 +2.262≈2.7046\n\nContinuing, u₄≈(2.7046 -1)/3≈1.7046/3≈0.5682, then u₄=x₄ +1/x₄≈0.5682 +1.759≈2.3271\n\nObserving that u_k seems to oscillate between approximately2.327 and2.7046, decreasing and increasing alternately. Not sure if converging.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence u_k satisfies a recurrence relation that can be linearized. But given the nonlinearity, it's challenging.\n\nGiven that all approaches so far haven't yielded a pattern, and given the problem's position (likely an Olympiad problem), there must be a trick or transformation that I'm missing.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose we define a new sequence where y_k =3^{k} (x_k -1/2).

So this approximation is invalid because the assumption that y_k is small may not hold for early terms. Therefore, this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven that all attempts to find a pattern or a linear recurrence have failed, perhaps there's a telescoping product or another insight. Let's revisit the original recurrence:\n\nx_{k+1} = (x_k +1/x_k -1)/3\n\nLet me multiply both sides by3:\n\n3x_{k+1} =x_k +1/x_k -1\n\nRearranged:\n\n1/x_k =3x_{k+1} +1 -x_k\n\nThis relates1/x_k to x_k and x_{k+1}.

    "Wait, no, previous approximation was x₄≈0.569, but actual computation shows x₄≈582,896,364/2,465,249,325≈0.236. Wait, this contradicts earlier approximations. Therefore, my earlier estimations were incorrect. This suggests that the sequence behavior is more complex.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the terms' numerators and denominators follow a pattern where a_{k+1}=a_k² +b_k² -a_k b_k and b_{k+1}=3a_k b_k, leading to rapid growth, making it impossible to compute directly. However, since the problem asks for m +n mod1000, perhaps there's a periodicity in m +n modulo1000 that can be exploited.",
    "Alternatively, notice that the recursion for a_k and b_k can be considered modulo1000 after some steps. However, since the problem involves fractions in reduced form, we need to compute m and n exactly, then take their sum modulo1000. Given the size of the numbers, this seems impossible unless there's a repeating cycle modulo1000 or some other property.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the sequence becomes periodic modulo1000 after some point. However, given the recursive nature involving multiplication and addition, it's challenging to predict without knowing the period.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the sequence reaches a fixed point modulo1000. For example, if after some k, x_{k}≡x_{k+1} mod something, but this is speculative.\n\nGiven the time I've spent without progress, I think I need to consider that this problem might require an insight that I'm missing. Let me revisit the original recurrence:\n\nx_{k+1} = (x_k +1/x_k -1)/3\n\nLet me consider writing this as:\n\n3x_{k+1} +1 =x_k +1/x_k\n\nLet me denote u_k =x_k +1/x_k, then:\n\n3x_{k+1} +1 =u_k\n\nAlso, note that u_{k+1}=x_{k+1} +1/x_{k+1}\n\nBut from the first equation, u_k=3x_{k+1} +1. Therefore:\n\nu_{k+1}=x_{k+1} +1/x_{k+1}= (u_k -1)/3 +3/(u_k -1)\n\nThis gives:\n\nu_{k+1}= (u_k -1)/3 +3/(u_k -1)\n\nLet me denote v_k=u_k -2. Then:\n\nu_k= v_k +2\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nu_{k+1}= (v_k +2 -1)/3 +3/(v_k +2 -1)= (v_k +1)/3 +3/(v_k +1)\n\nThus:\n\nu_{k+1}= (v_k +1)/3 +3/(v_k +1)\n\nBut u_{k+1}=v_{k+1} +2, so:\n\nv_{k+1} +2= (v_k +1)/3 +3/(v_k +1)\n\nRearranged:\n\nv_{k+1}= (v_k +1)/3 +3/(v_k +1) -2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (v_k +1)/3 -2 +3/(v_k +1)\n\n= (v_k +1 -6)/3 +3/(v_k +1)\n\n= (v_k -5)/3 +3/(v_k +1)\n\nThis still looks complicated. Let me compute the first few terms of v_k:\n\nu₁=x₁ +1/x₁=25/11 +11/25=746/275≈2.7127. Thus v₁=u₁ -2≈0.7127\n\nCompute u₂=(v₁ +1)/3 +3/(v₁ +1)= (1.7127)/3 +3/1.7127≈0.5709 +1.751≈2.3219. Thus v₂≈0.3219\n\nSimilarly, u₃=(v₂ +1)/3 +3/(v₂ +1)= (1.3219)/3 +3/1.3219≈0.4406 +2.268≈2.7086. Thus v₃≈0.7086\n\nu₄=(v₃ +1)/3 +3/(v₃ +1)=1.7086/3 +3/1.7086≈0.5695 +1.754≈2.3235. Thus v₄≈0.3235\n\nu₅=(v₄ +1)/3 +3/(v₄ +1)=1.3235/3 +3/1.3235≈0.4412 +2.267≈2.7082. Thus v₅≈0.7082\n\nObserving that v_k oscillates between approximately0.708 and0.323, getting closer each time. This suggests that the sequence u_k is converging to a fixed point. Let's solve for the fixed point v where v= (v +1)/3 +3/(v +1) -2\n\nLet me set v= (v +1)/3 +3/(v +1) -2\n\nMultiply both sides by3(v +1):\n\n3(v +1)v= (v +1)^2 +9 -6(v +1)\n\nExpand:\n\n3v² +3v= v² +2v +1 +9 -6v -6\n\nSimplify right-hand side:\n\nv² +2v +1 +9 -6v -6= v² -4v +4\n\nThus:\n\n3v² +3v= v² -4v +4\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n2v² +7v -4=0\n\nSolve:\n\nv=(-7 ±sqrt(49 +32))/4=(-7 ±sqrt(81))/4=(-7 ±9)/4\n\nPositive solution: (2)/4=0.5\n\nNegative solution: (-16)/4=-4\n\nSince v represents u -2 and u=x +1/x ≥2 (by AM ≥GM), v≥0. Thus the fixed point is v=0.5. Therefore, the sequence v_k converges to0.5, so u_k converges to2.5, and x_k converges to0.5 or2. But since the sequence alternates around0.5, it converges to0.5.\n\nHowever, convergence doesn't help us find the exact value at2025. Given the time invested and lack of progress, I think the answer is likely converges to1/2, but since it's a fraction, perhaps after sufficiently many steps, the terms become1/2. However, starting from25/11, which is not1/2, and applying rational operations, it's impossible to reach1/2 exactly. Therefore, there must be a pattern in the recursion that leads to a linear recurrence which can be solved.",
    "Wait, perhaps the key is to recognize that the recurrence can be transformed into a linear recurrence through reciprocal substitution. Let me try:\n\nLet y_k =1/x_k.

    "Given that all approaches lead to dead ends, and considering the problem's difficulty, I think the intended solution is to recognize that the sequence satisfies x_{k+2} =x_k, leading to a period-2 cycle.

However, if there's an exact period-2 cycle, then x_{k+2}=x_k. Let's test this.\n\nAssume x_{k+2}=x_k. Then:\n\nx_{k+1}= (x_k +1/x_k -1)/3\n\nx_{k+2}= (x_{k+1} +1/x_{k+1} -1)/3= x_k\n\nThus:\n\nx_k= (x_{k+1} +1/x_{k+1} -1)/3\n\nBut x_{k+1}= (x_k +1/x_k -1)/3. Substitute:\n\nx_k= [ (x_k +1/x_k -1)/3 +3/(x_k +1/x_k -1) -1 ] /3\n\nThis equation must hold for x_k in the cycle. Let's assume x_k=a and x_{k+1}=b.

Let's substitute one equation into the other.\n\nFrom first equation:3a =b +1/b -1 → 3a +1 =b +1/b\n\nFrom second equation:3b +1 =a +1/a\n\nSo we have:\n\n3a +1 =b +1/b ...(1)\n\n3b +1 =a +1/a ...(2)\n\nLet me denote p=a +1/a and q=b +1/b.

Then from equation (3):a +1/a=3a +1 →1/a=2a +1 →2a² +a -1=0. Solutions:a=(-1 ±sqrt(1 +8))/4=(-1 ±3)/4. Thus a=1/2 or a=-1. Since x_k is positive, a=1/2. Thus the fixed point.\n\nCase2:4ab -1=0 →ab=1/4.\n\nFrom equation (3):a +1/a=3b +1\n\nFrom equation (4):b +1/b=3a +1\n\nSinceab=1/4, then b=1/(4a). Substitute into equation (3):\n\na +1/a=3*(1/(4a)) +1 →a +1/a=3/(4a) +1\n\nMultiply both sides by4a:\n\n4a² +4=3 +4a\n\n→4a² -4a +1=0\n\nDiscriminant:16 -16=0 →a=(4)/8=0.5\n\nThus a=0.5, then b=1/(4*0.5)=0.5. Thus this reduces to Case1.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is a=b=1/2. Thus the cycle assumption leads back to the fixed point, implying no nontrivial cycles.

Let's see how many terms after x₇:\n\n2025 -7 +1=2019 terms. Since the cycle is2, starting from x₇, odd indices≡681, even≡761. Since2025 is odd, x_{2025}≡681 mod1000.",
    "But wait, x₇ is the7th term, which is odd, sum≡681. Then x₉ (9th), x_{11}, etc., also odd, sum≡681. Therefore, x_{2025}≡681 mod1000.\n\nBut let's verify the cycle length. From x₇ onward, the pattern is681,761,681,761,...\n\nThus, starting at term7, the cycle period is2. The number of terms from7 to2025 is2025 -7 +1=2019 terms.2019 divided by2 gives1009 cycles with remainder1. Thus term2025 is the first in the cycle, which is681.\n\nTherefore, the answer is681.\n"
